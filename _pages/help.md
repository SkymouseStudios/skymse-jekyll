### Your lifeline is here.
Sometimes things can be tricky to understand, so we have a simple breakdown of some problems people often are trying to solve.

#### What does Skymouse actually do?
We solve your design problems. So that means everything and anything you need help with, we can find a solution for, even if that means we need to farm the job out to someone else.

#### What services do I need first?
It depends. A website is super important, but doesn’t mean to much of you don’t have a logo or any strong visual representation of your company. But no worries! That’s why Skymouse works with aspiring brands, like yourself, to find out exactly what you need to maximize your time, and your budget. And then we get it done.

#### What if I have a limited budget?
Hey, we understand! It happens. We’ll do our absolute best to create a package that fits you and your budget. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to take it!

#### So What is this Subscription Model thing?
It’s a beautiful way you can have a personal design team, but only when you need it! We can jump into action as soon as you have something you need! Pay as you grow.

#### Couldn’t I just get this done for 5 bucks on Odesk?
Odesk absolutely has it’s time and place, it’s a great resource, but it doesn’t provide the same quality you can get from a team that is looking at the big picture—focusing on your brand. You could very easily dump some ideas into a Wordpress template, but your customers can tell the difference.

#### Does Skymouse use WordPress templates?
We would rather not. Wordpress templates are becoming the bane of the web as they all look pretty much the same. Templets also don’t allow for the customization you really need to show you are different and special. There's a blog post for that.
