					<div class="content">
						<h3>What we do.</h3>
						<p>Everyone and their mother can use photoshop. Anyone can slap a Wordpress template up in the internet. There are too many “companies” that make money off mediocrity.  It’s our goal to change all that.
						</p>
						<p>We moved out to Indianapolis and lived in a small dark apartment together and didn’t get much work done. But we argued a lot and talked about how cool we were. Wives were found, and money needed to be made so we finally buckled down and started doing cool stuff that actually got us places.</p>

					<h3>Who we work with.</h3>
					<p>Every project is different and has new, exciting challenges. We love what we do and we try to share it with anyone who will listen. Check out some of our past projects here. You can also follow the action (almost) live on one of our social media accounts.</p>
					<p>	
					We love our families and our friends and are always trying to help the people that we work with and interact with. We may not be saving lives, but we can definitely make people’s lives easier and (hopefully) happier.

					<h3>How we work.</h3>
					<p>We want to do great things. We have so many ideas and dreams, some crazy, others not to far off into the future. For us, Skymouse isn’t just where we work–it’s a lifestyle. We are craftsman and as long as we are crafting something, we are happy. We love entertainment and are always trying to find new ways to keep people entertained, including ourselves. No matter what, family comes first and we are just trying to make our way through the universe to provide the best we have to offer. We want to be proud of what we do. Our wives demand it.</p>
