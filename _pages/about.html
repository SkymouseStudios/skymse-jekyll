				<h2>We're no corporate fat cat. We hate cats.</h2>
				<p>We get asked a lot, “who’s your ideal client?” The answer is pretty simple. Our ideal client is a company that wants to know themselves better and share it with their employees, clients and competitors.</p>

					<h3>Why we do.</h3>
					<p>You know that feeling you get when you see a pickup artist hitting on a girl from out of town? That's how we feel watching other marketing companies. We exist because we're tired of seeing predatory marketing agencies take advantage of unsuspecting businesses. Marketing should be straightforward, goal-oriented, action-driven, and measured by results.</p>

					<p>We get out of bed in the morning because our alarm clocks go off... but also because we have a vision. One where every business knows how to effectively communicate their unique talents and offerings to the marketplace.</p>

				<h3>What we do.</h3>
				<p>Everyone and their mother can come up with a slogan. It’s pretty easy to “describe your company in 5 adjectives.”</p>

				<p>You know what’s hard? Admitting who isn’t your customer. Dropping your highest revenue customer because they don't align with the vision of your brand. Teaching your company why you exist and why the marketplace should care. </p>

				<p>We partner with companies who are ready to make the tough choices to see their business flourish like never before.</p>

				<h3>How we do.</h3>
				<p>I believe it was Confucius who said, “if you don’t have a process, you don’t have sh*t.” I might be paraphrasing, but he’s right. Process, process, and then more process.</p>

				<p>While XYZ Marketing is explaining the psychological impact of Helvetica Light Augmented Arial Bold Universal Typeface, we’re busy getting the job done.</p>
	
				<p>We take you through specific exercises designed to teach you and then your customers who you are and why you matter. Principles exist for one reason – to drive actions. We got the principles down a long time ago, now we just focus on executing. </p>

				<h3>Where we work.</h3>
				<p>We are currently based out of the flat lands of Indianapolis, Indiana. In the crossroads of America. It's our favorite city—sure we might be a bit biased, but the people are nice, the food is delicious and there is always something to do. All without the horrific traffic of some of the more "pop-culture" cities out there.</p>

				<p>Home of the Pacers, neighbors to companies like Eli Lilly, Vera Bradley, Lids, Indiana has a lot to offer and we're excited to help make Indiana a better place, and hopefully one day that can reach the rest of the world.</p>
