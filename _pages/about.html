			<h2>We're no corporate fat cat. <br>We hate cats.</h2>
			<p>We get asked a lot: “Who’s your ideal client?” The answer is pretty simple. Our ideal client is an organization that wants to share their brand with their employees, clients and competitors.</p>

			<h3>Marketing should be straight-forward.</h3>
			<p>You know that feeling you get when you see a pickup artist hitting on a girl from out of town? That's how we feel watching other marketing companies. We exist because we're tired of marketing agencies taking advantage of unsuspecting businesses.</p>

			<p>We'd love to see a world where every business can effectively communicate their unique talents and offerings to the marketplace.</p>

			<h3>Focus on the ONE thing.</h3>
			<p>You know what’s hard? Admitting who isn’t your customer. Dropping your highest revenue customer because they don't align with the vision of your brand. Teaching your company why you exist and why the marketplace should care.</p>

			<p>We partner with companies who are ready to make the tough choices to see their business flourish like never before.</p>
