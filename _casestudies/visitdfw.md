elevator-pitch: Visit DFW is a Dallas-based tourism site, curating events and things
  to do around the entire central Texas region.
A-title: Everything you need.
A-subtitle: All in one place.
A-p: For the home page, we realized the program wasnâ€™t very clearly explained nor
  was the mission of the program communicated.

B-title: Do I need change?
B-subtitle: Convincing modern man.
B-p: Our biggest challenge was phrasing things correctly and making changes effectively
  on a budget. Those Catholic Men wanted to make sure donors money was being used
  effectively and making a difference in sales.

audience-title: Another goal
audience-subtitle: Building the team.
audience-p: Not only is the program geared for men, but we also wanted to target parishes
  as a whole, getting priests and parish leaders on board so they could transform
  their community.

artwork-title: Looks matter.
artwork-subtitle: Using Icons and Images.
artwork-p: One of the best ways to engage is by using images people can understand.
  We worked with designer Carrie Smith to design some fun, simple designs that supported
  the copy and the visitdfw brand.

C-title: A promise of change.
C-subtitle: Looking back at the progress.
C-p: A large part of the website is engaging users, regardless of if they decide to
  register immediately or just keep an eye on the program. We helped the visitdfw
  team capture emails effectly and leverage groups so that their marketing follow-up
  campaigns would get in front of the right people.

Those Catholic Men asked us to help redesign and maintain visitdfw.com to make it all clearer.

With thousands of new registrations happening each year, the site is a huge driver of growth. We worked closely with Those Catholic Men, both onsite and offsite to improve conversion and better communicate the brand.

By making the site comprehensive, easy to navigate and focusing on prospects, the redesign aims to increase the impact of visitdfw.com on the bottom line.
