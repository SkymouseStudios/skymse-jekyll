elevator-pitch-title: Beginning the journey
elevator-pitch: Exodus 90 is a 90 day spiritual exercise for Catholic men. Exodus
  90 helps men to detach from technology, ditch bad habits, and grow in their faith.
A-title: Find your Exodus.
A-subtitle: Getting out of the desert.
A-p: The Exodus 90 homepage was due for an overhaul. Working with Exodus 90 Director
  James Baxter, we realized the program wasn’t very clearly explained nor was the
  mission of the program communicated. Skymouse developed a beautiful custom WordPress
  page template that made it easy for the non-technical team at Exodus 90 to edit.
  The template was also reusable for other landing pages requiring the same layout.

B-title: Do I need change?
B-subtitle: Convincing modern men.
B-p: People don't like to change. The Exodus 90 Homepage shows there is more to life
  once men overcome their enslavement to distractions.

audience-title: Who’s the audience?
audience-subtitle: Changing perspective.
audience-p: Not only is the program geared for men, but it also can target parishes
  as a whole. We developed a custom page showing pastors and parish leaders how easy
  it is to transform their community with Exodus 90.

artwork-title: Looks matter.
artwork-subtitle: Using Icons and Images.
artwork-p: One of the best ways to engage is by using images people can understand.
  Since everyone hates stock images, we decided to do something different. We designed
  some fun, simple illustrations that supported the message of the Exodus 90 brand.

C-subtitle: Using Mailchimp effectively.
C-p: A large part of a website is engaging users, whether they decide to register
  immediately or not. We helped the Exodus 90 team capture emails effectly and organize
  their data so  their follow-up campaigns would get in front of the right people.

Exodus 90 asked us to help redesign, develop and maintain exodus90.com to make it easier to use and reach more users.

With thousands of new registrations happening each year, the site is a huge driver of growth. We worked closely with Director James Baxter and his team, both on-site and off-site, to improve conversion and better communicate the brand.

By making the site comprehensive, easy to navigate and user focused, the redesign aims to increase the impact of Exodus 90 around the world.
