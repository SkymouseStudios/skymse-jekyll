# Introduction
elevator-pitch-title: Beginning the journey
elevator-pitch: Exodus 90 is a non-profit program helping men to detach from technology, media and make a better man of themselves.

# Highlight 1
1-title: Find your Exodus.
1-subtitle: Get out of the desert.
1-p: For the home page, we realized the program wasn’t very clearly explained nor was the mission of the program communicated.

# Highlight 2
2-title: Do I need change?
2-subtitle: Convincing modern man.
2-p: Our biggest challenge was phrasing things correctly and making changes effectively on a budget. Those Catholic Men wanted to make sure donors money was being used effectively and making a difference in sales.

# Header Artwork
artwork-title: Looks matter.
artwork-subtitle: Using Icons and Images.
artwork-p: One of the best ways to engage is by using images people can understand. We worked with illustrator Patrick Hanus to design some fun, simple designs that supported the copy and the Exodus 90 brand.

# Highlight 3
3-title: Making a list, checking it twice.
3-subtitle: Using Mailchimp effectively.
3-p: A large part of the website is engaging users, regardless of if they decide to register immediately or just keep an eye on the program. We helped the Exodus 90 team capture emails effectly and leverage groups so that their marketing follow-up campaigns would get in front of the right people.

Those Catholic Men asked us to help redesign and maintain exodus90.com to make it all clearer.

With thousands of new registrations happening each year, the site is a huge driver of growth. We worked closely with Those Catholic Men, both onsite and offsite to improve conversion and better communicate the brand.

By making the site comprehensive, easy to navigate and focusing on prospects, the redesign aims to increase the impact of exodus90.com on the bottom line.
