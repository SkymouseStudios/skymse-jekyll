# Introduction
elevator-pitch-title: Grow your business.
elevator-pitch: RESOURCE Commercial Real Estate is a local Indianapolis Firm helping businesses find new property, sell current property or manage their real estate.

# Highlight A
A-title: Everything you need.
A-subtitle: All in one place.
A-p: For the home page, we realized the program wasnâ€™t very clearly explained nor was the mission of the program communicated.

# Highlight B
B-title: Do I need change?
B-subtitle: Convincing modern man.
B-p: Our biggest challenge was phrasing things correctly and making changes effectively on a budget. Those Catholic Men wanted to make sure donors money was being used effectively and making a difference in sales.

# Header Artwork

# Highlight 3
C-title: A promise of change.
C-subtitle: Looking back at the progress.
C-p: A large part of the website is engaging users, regardless of if they decide to register immediately or just keep an eye on the program. We helped the RESOURCE team capture emails effectly and leverage groups so that their marketing follow-up campaigns would get in front of the right people.

Those Catholic Men asked us to help redesign and maintain resource.com to make it all clearer.

With thousands of new registrations happening each year, the site is a huge driver of growth. We worked closely with Those Catholic Men, both onsite and offsite to improve conversion and better communicate the brand.

By making the site comprehensive, easy to navigate and focusing on prospects, the redesign aims to increase the impact of resource.com on the bottom line.
