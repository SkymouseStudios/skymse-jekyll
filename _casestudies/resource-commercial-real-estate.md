elevator-pitch-title: Love your space.
elevator-pitch: RESOURCE Commercial Real Estate is a locally-owned Indianapolis firm
  helping businesses find, sell or manage commercial real estate.
A-title: Everything you need.
A-subtitle: All in one place.
A-p: Resource has many offerings. The challenge was to helps users find what they
  need and do it with ease. After multiple iterations, we landed on a layout that
  worked.

B-title: Sir, We've Made Contact.
B-subtitle: Making engagement easy.
B-p: The old website wasn't generating any leads. Many of the site users are in a
  rush and don't want to bother with contact forms. By incorporating an online chat
  service known as Drift, we were able to go from no leads to 9 qualified leads a
  month.

  reinvent the wheel. It was a fun challege to use those design tools in a new and
  creative way.

artwork-title: Looks matter.
artwork-subtitle: Using Icons and Images.
artwork-p: One of the best ways to engage is by using images people can understand.
  We worked with designer Carrie Smith to design some fun, simple designs that supported
  the copy and the RESOURCE brand.

C-title: A promise of change.
C-subtitle: Looking back at the progress.
C-p: A large part of the website is engaging users, regardless of if they decide to
  register immediately or just keep an eye on the program. We helped the RESOURCE
  team capture emails effectly and leverage groups so that their marketing follow-up
  campaigns would get in front of the right people.

RESOURCE had recently gotten a new website. The problem was the new site was not engaging, had very little traffic and was on the 3rd page of Google. Much of the site's information was out of date or missing.

As Indianapolis's largest locally owned firm, RESOURCE needed a site that would be easy to find and help users contact brokers to help them with their needs.

This required a specialized WordPress Theme that would make rcre.com look and work like it should. The team also requested a custom back-end allowing non-technical folks to make edits.
