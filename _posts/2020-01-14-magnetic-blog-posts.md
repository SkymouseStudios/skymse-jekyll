## That's What I'm Talkin' About!

Everybody wants to know how to write that perfect blog post. They want their post to "go viral."

It's so attractive, isn't it? The idea of writing that one blog that just "resonates" with your audience and beyond. We all dream of getting that notification. The one that tells us we just got 30,000 hits in 24 hours.

Going viral is not a pipe dream! There are people _right now_ who are getting those exact, mindblowing results. Every FEELING you want, every idea you've got about being the next article making the rounds on LinkedIn, it's all attainable.

What virality all comes down to is the _topic_. 

**Headlines will get you clicks, TOPICS will get you shares.**

## 5 Ways To Generate Magnetic Blog Topics

So let's get right into it. There are 5 specific ways to generate blog topics that are relevant, useful, and traffic-generating. You are five simple questions away from generating some magnetic, going-viral-worthy blog topics!

### Question #1 - What do You Wish Your Current Customers Stopped Asking You?

If you often receive the same questions over and over again, these are a great start for blog post ideas. Chances are really good that if you receive recurring or very similar questions from multiple different customers, that means it's a topic _everyone_ is interested in. It also means that there isn't a lot of content written about it yet, otherwise, you probably wouldn't be getting asked about it so often!

> Find questions that you wish your customers stopped asking you and write a blog post about it.

Then, you can just point your customers to that post when they ask about the topic--helping them out _and_ earning engagement with your posts. In addition, you'll be generating traffic from people who aren't your customers but still need an answer to that question.

Current customer blog topic examples:

* How Do I Change My Password in Microsoft Office?
* What's the Best Lawn Seed to Use in the Midwest?
* How Do I Create an Email Campaign in Mailchimp?

### Question #2 - What are the Main Questions Your Prospects Are Asking You?

When you find yourself hearing the same questions in sales meetings, use those questions to write blog posts. Prospect questions are a window into the mind of your ideal customer.

> You know what problems you THINK you solve, customers know what problems you ACTUALLY solve.

When you get asked a question in a sales meeting, that's a question that many other prospects likely have. Answer it and that's more traffic to your blog.

Prospective customer blog topic examples:

* Why on Earth Would I Pay 30% More for Leather Seats?
* What's the Difference Between a Granite and a Solid-Surface Counter-Top?
* Why Do You Recommend Mailchimp Over Constant Contact?

### Question #3 - What Are Helpful Pieces of Information People Outside of Your Industry Don't Know?

Every industry has an inside and an outside. **There are rarely times when prospects understand what goes on inside your industry.** They are usually masters of their own industry, but clueless when it comes to dealing with vendors in unfamiliar sectors.

Choose a topic where you explain some terminology or shed light on insider processes to assist those on the outside of your industry.

Industry-specific blog topic examples:

* What It Means When Your Financial Adviser Uses These 3 Words.
* How to Keep Your Mechanic From Ruining Your Oil Pan.
* 5 Ways to Know If Your IT Company Is Lying To You.

### Question #4 - What Are the Biggest Problems Facing Your Prospects?

It's true that your prospects know their specific problems better than you; however, _you do_ have value to bring to the table because you deal with similar companies facing similar situations.

> You have a breadth of experience that is valuable to your prospects.

By sharing stories and ideas from solutions you've seen work with your customers, you can bring value to businesses that may not know who you are yet.

Problem-solving blog topic examples:

* 2 Weird Tricks You Can Use to Double Your LinkedIn Connection Rate.
* The Easiest Way to Increase Employee Retention.
* 5 Things Every Small Business Needs to Do to Market Themselves in 2020.

### Question #5 - What Are the Biggest Problems Facing Your Industry?

This question feels a little weird at first, but it's a winner. Every single industry has problems. There are always shady operators who are trying to take advantage of busy and overwhelmed businesses. There will always be regulation issues or security breaches or just plain old corruption.

If you make a habit of pointing out when things are wrong in your own industry, you will gain trust and establish yourself as a business with integrity. **Admitting your own mistakes is also a great way to share knowledge whilst creating a bond and growing trust.**

Industry problem blog topic examples:

* Why CEO's Should Be Accountable for Employee Fraud.
* 4 Ways Hotels Cut Corners (And What You Can Do About It).
* The 5 Worst Cyber-Security Failures and How They Could Have Been Avoided.

### Putting This Magnetic Blog Topics Production into Practice

The ideas outlined in this article are only a starting point. It's up to you to take these five questions and apply them to your industry. 

Imagine you're sitting at your computer about to look something up on Google. What question are you typing into Google? Why are you typing it? Do you think other people have the same question? _They do._

This is the truth about blogs. **They only work if you give your readers the power to do it without you--value.** If they finished your post yet still are unable to solve their problem/finish the task themselves, you haven't done your job. 

At the end of the day, your readers have problems. Teach them to solve those problems, thoroughly yet concisely. If you approach your blog topics from this perspective, your posts will be magnetic.
