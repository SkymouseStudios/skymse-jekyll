## That's What I'm Talking About

Everybody wants to know how to write that perfect blog post. They want their post to "go viral."

It's so attractive, isn't it? The idea of writing that one blog which just "resonates." We all dream of getting that notification. The one that tells us we just got 30,000 hits in 24 hours.

It's not just a pipe dream, though. There are people right now getting exactly those results. Every FEELING you want, every idea you've got about being the next article making the rounds on LinkedIn, it's all attainable.

What it all comes down to is the the TOPIC. **Headlines will get you clicks, TOPICS will get you shares.**

## 5 Ways To Generate Blog Topics

So let's get right into it. There are 5 specific ways to generate blog topics that are relevant, useful, and traffic-generating. All of them are questions you ask yourself.

### Question #1 - What Do You Wish Your Customers Stopped Asking You?

If you've got questions that seem to be recurring, those are a great place to start for blog post ideas. Chances are really good that if you're getting a question over and over from different customers, that means it's a topic everyone is interested in. It also means that there isn't a lot of content around it yet, otherwise you probably wouldn't be getting asked about it.

> Find questions that you wish you customers stopped asking you and write a blog post about it. 

Then you can just point your customers to that post when they ask about it. In addition, you'll be generating traffic from people who aren't your customers but still need an answer to that question.

Blog topic examples:

- How Do I Change My Password In Microsoft Office?
- What's the Best Lawn Seed to Use in the Midwest?
- How Do I Create an Email Campaign in Mailchimp?

### Question #2 - What Are the Main Questions Your Prospects Are Asking You?

When you find yourself hearing the same questions in sales meetings, use those questions to write blog posts. Prospect questions are a window in the mind of your ideal customer. 

> You know what problems you THINK you solve, customers know what problems you ACTUALLY solve. 

When you get asked a question in a sales meeting, that's a question than many other prospect likely have. Answer it and they'll show up on your blog.

Blog topic examples:

- Why on Earth Would I Pay 30% More for Leather Seats?
- What's the Difference Between a Granite and a Solid-Surface Counter-Top?
- Why Do You Recommend Mailchimp over Constant Contact?

### Question #3 - What Are Helpful Pieces of Information People Outside Your Industry Don't Know?

Every industry has an inside and an outside. **There are rarely times where prospects understand what goes on inside your industry.** They are usually masters of their own industry, but clueless when it comes to dealing with vendors in unfamiliar sectors.

Blog topic examples:

- What It Means When Your Financial Adviser Uses These 3 Words.
- How to Keep Your Mechanic From Ruining Your Oil Pan.
- 5 Ways To Know If Your IT Company Is Lying To You.

### Question #4 - What Are the Biggest Problems Facing Your Prospects?

It's true that your prospects know their problems better than you do. However, you do have value to add because you tend to deal with similar companies in all sorts of situations. 

> You have a breadth of experience that is valuable to your prospects. 

By sharing stories and ideas from things you've seen work with your customers, you can bring value to businesses that may not know who you are yet.

Blog topic examples:

- 2 Weird Tricks You Can Use to Double Your LinkedIn Connection Rate.
- The Easiest Way To Increase Employee Retention.
- 5 Things Every Small Business Needs To Do To Market Themselves in 2020.

### Question #5 - What Are the Biggest Problems Facing Your Industry

This question feels a little weird at first, but it's a winner. Every single industry has problems. There are always shady operators who are trying to take advantage of busy and overwhelmed businesses. There are always regulation issues or security breaches or just plain old corruption.

If you make a habit of pointing out when things are wrong in your own industry, you will gain trust and establish yourself as a business with integrity. **Admitting your own mistakes is also a great way to share knowledge while creating a bond and growing trust.**

### Putting It Into Practice

The ideas outlined in this article are a starting point. It's up to you to take this and apply it to your industry. Imagine you're sitting at your computer about to look something up on Google. What question are you typing into Google? Why are you typing it? Do you think other people have the same question?

This is the truth about blogs. **They only work if you give your readers the power to do it without you.** If they can't finish your post and do the work themselves, you haven't done your job. At the end of the day, your readers have problems. Teach them to solve those problems, all the way. If you approach your blog topics from this perspective, your posts will be magnetic.
