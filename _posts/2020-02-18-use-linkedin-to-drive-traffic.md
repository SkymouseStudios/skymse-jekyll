As established in my earlier post, [LinkedIn is a great way to drive traffic]({% post_url 2020-02-14-increase-engagment-on-linkedin %}) to your business's website. Here are four methods on how to use LinkedIn to increase traffic to your website:

## #1 - Create a Company Page on LinkedIn

The **company page** is an underrated and underutilized part of what LinkedIn offers. I can't count the number of times I've wanted to learn more about someone and they have no company page setup and no way to find their website. I've literally been forced to Google their company name to find their website. It doesn't have to be this hardâ€”not to mention **most people will not work this hard to learn more about what you have to offer.**

Here's what the company page looks like. As shown below, once you've linked your website, there's a button that makes it simple for potential clients to access your website from LinkedIn. This is also another great opportunity for you to showcase and market your brand.

## #2 - Leave Outbound Links as Comments On Your LinkedIn Posts

You've probably heard the term "LinkedIn algorithm." LinkedIn has an automatic system for determining which posts to promote and which posts to ignore based on various pre-set factors. When you see something in your feed, LinkedIn has specifically chosen to show that article, post, etc to you. I am no algorithm expert, so I'm not going to pretend to know exactly how the LinkedIn algorithm works...

What I do know is that **LinkedIn doesn't like it when you link to outside websites in your posts.**  LinkedIn wants you to spend as much time as possible on _their platform_, so their algorithm prefers native posts and links that won't send other users off to another platform. In other words, don't share a link to YouTube, post a video directly inside of LinkedIn.

This specific algorithmic preference is why you should use your comments section to **share links to your website or to landing pages that you want people to visit.**

For example:

As you can see above, I've commented on my own post with the link to our [Skymouse content library](https://lab.skymousestudios.com "Skymouse Labs"). If anyone wants to learn more about how they can do their own marketing, they can click the link in the comments. This allows me to generate traffic to my website without peeving the LinkedIn algorithm and getting my post shuttered.

## #3 - Add Blog Posts To Your LinkedIn "About" Section

On your main profile page, you have an "about" section where you can write your bio and tell your story. You should also add blog posts to this section because it adds valuable "freebie" content to your "about" section and creates _another_ path for people to get to your website through your profile. It's very simple.

1. Just click the "edit" button (the pencil) on the right side of the "about" section.

2. The "Edit about" box will pop up which allows you to link to blog posts on your own website. This well-placed plug of _free_ content is a simple way to drive people to your website and gain credibility with that potential client.

## #4 - Turn your Blogs into Articles and Have a "Read More" Link

Articles are a fantastic way to start generating website traffic through LinkedIn. If you've never written an article, don't panic! It's really easy. Just re-use your blog posts! Here are the steps:

1. On the main LinkedIn page, you'll see a link under the box where you write posts. Click the "Write an article" link.

2. That link will take you to a page where you can add a picture, a title, and then write some content!

3. Here's the easy part. Simply take a blog post that you've already written on your website and use it as your LinkedIn article. Just upload the main image of your blog post and use the same title!

4. In the body of the article, copy and paste the first 1/3 to 1/2 of your blog post exactly as it appears on your website. Then at the end of the article, add the link to your full post on your website and write something like "click the link below to read more."
