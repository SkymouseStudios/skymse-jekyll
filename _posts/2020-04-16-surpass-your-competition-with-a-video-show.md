## Seeing Marketing in a Whole New Light

Marketing has always been misunderstood. Most people see it as a way to educate others on what you do for them. The reality is a little different. Marketing means proof. Proof you are who you say you are. Proof you will live up to your promises. Proof you're in it for more than just a sale. 

![Street Lights](/uploads/021-street-lights-802024.jpg)

My mom used to say "actions speak louder than words." As a kid, I hated when she said that, usually because she was right. In marketing, this couldn't be more accurate. You can't tell people, you have to show them. 

One of the best ways to show people you want to help them is to offer help without asking them to pay. Sounds simple, I know, but it’s pretty much the ONLY thing that businesses and marketing agencies DON’T do when it comes to marketing. 

“Everything is fair game, just please, for the love of mud, don’t give anything away!“

## Why Videocast?

There are several reasons why creating a videocast is a great idea.

First, video content makes the best pillar content. By that I mean when you create video content, it has the best shelf life of any kind of content. 

![Person Holding a Camera](/uploads/021-action-adult-aperture-blur-320617.jpg)

When you create video content you can immediately pull out the audio and post it as a podcast. Then you can post the video on YouTube and embed it on your site and all over your social media. Next you can transcribe the audio and turn it into a blog. 

> From one piece of pillar content, you can create 5, 6, 7, or more pieces of individual content and release those across multiple channels.

Second, video content communicates better. When you use video content, your audience gets the full-spectrum of human communication. **You may already know this, but your actual words only represent about 7% of human communication.**

The other 93% includes body language, tonality, and facial expressions. All of these are present in video content. 

Finally, it’s really stinkin’ easy. Video is one of the easiest forms of content to create. There’s a little bit of upfront setup involved (webcam, microphone, maybe a background), but once you’ve done that work, it’s easy-peezy, lemon-squeezy. 

## How To Create A Videocast

Once you’ve reached the inevitable conclusion that videocasting is the next best thing since frozen pizza, you’re ready to get started. Here are some of the tools we use:

![Logitech Webcam](/uploads/021-webcam.png)

You’ll need a webcam. [The Logitech C920](https://dell.to/2wtlEah) is a great option and more than gets the job done. 

![Yeti Microphone](/uploads/021-yeti.png)

You’ll need a microphone. [The Blue Yeti](https://bit.ly/2V0KXdj) has been serving podcasters and show hosts for years. It’s a solid option at a great price. 

![Skype Logo](/uploads/021-skype.png)

You’ll need a way to record your interviews. [Skype is free](https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/) and works great. They have an option to setup a meeting room, and the guest just has to click a link to hop on the call. Recording is as easy as clicking the “record” button. 

P.S. If you're feeling extra adventurous and you want to do some live-streaming, [check out OBS](https://obsproject.com/). It's free and a pretty powerful solution for live-streaming and local video recording. 

Congratulations! You’re ready for your first guest.

## Coercing, I Mean, Inviting Guests

Here’s where the rubber hits the road. So many business videocasts and podcasts have one aim in mind: find potential prospects and interview them. 

While I understand this, and applaud their focus, following this path will lead to a boring show. There’s only so much that can be said about the specific industry you’re in or the ideas that your prospects may have. 

In addition, if every single guest on your show is the exact same person from a different company, it starts to look really obvious that you’re just interviewing prospects. 

This is why you want to start with a purpose or main goal for your show and go from there. What kind of content are you creating? Is this financial sector information, technology, marketing, sales, HR, or something else?

Once you have a general concept that you’re focusing on, now you can address that topic from many different angles. For example, let’s say you’re in the financial services business. Your main prospects are commercial bankers. Imagine if the only guests you had on the show were commercial bankers? 

That would get really boring for all the bankers. 

What if, instead of focusing only on commercial bankers, you **focused on PROBLEMS** that commercial bankers deal with? Now you’ve got tons more potential guests you can bring on AND, you’ve got way more value you can bring to those bankers. 

You can bring on Directors of IT to talk about cybersecurity in the financial services industry. You can bring on stock market analysts, sales gurus, AND other commercial bankers.

### Bringing Home The Bacon

So, we’re finally at the point where you’re ready to start bringing guests onto your show.

To start with, make a list of everyone you know that would be relevant to your topics and would immediately come on the show just because you asked them.

It’s highly likely, if you’re a commercial banker, that you already know an IT company that specializes in the financial sector. Call your IT vendor and ask them to come on the show, they will gladly oblige. 

Pick three of your best customers and ask them to come on the show. This is a great way to strengthen your relationship and give them a platform to share their expertise. 

From here, start reaching out to your business friends that work in relevant industries. 

It’s almost a guarantee that you have 12 people that you could schedule for a video interview, right now. At one episode per week, that’s 3 months of guests just to start. 

### Prospecting For Guests

Once you’ve run out of easy prey, the real work begins. 

Finding guests for your show is a science and an art. The good news is that once you’ve started the ball rolling, it’s much easier to invite guests you don’t know. When you’ve got a page on your website that you can send potential guests to, it makes the whole thing feel way more legit. 

> The best way to find guests is to make friends. LinkedIn is going to be your best friend for finding and scheduling guests for your videocast.

There are two different guests you want. The first are subject matter experts that can deliver valuable information to your audience. The second are members of your audience that you would like to eventually turn into customers. 

#### Subject Matter Experts

To start, post daily on your LinkedIn about relevant information for your industry. Try to blend personal and professional. My goal is to do 2 personal and 3 business posts per week. 

Next, begin engaging with people who you would like to bring on the show. Find their profiles, follow their content, and begin engaging with their content in a genuine and honest way. Like their posts and comment meaningfully and build a genuine relationship. 

#### Potential Customers

At the same time you’re building your organic reach by posting and engaging with subject matter experts, begin an outreach cadence to potential customers that you would like to bring on the show. Build a list in Sales Navigator of 500 of your ideal prospects and begin reaching out to 25 per week.

We’re going to take a quick sidebar and discuss value collateral that you will need to execute an outreach cadence.

### What Is “Value Collateral”

Value collateral is free content that is actually valuable to your audience. Also, you give it away free. Hence the “value” part. 

Creating value collateral is essential to any outreach cadence. **You CANNOT ask for something until you have given something away.** More precisely, you can't ask for anything until you have given multiple things away. 

> The best way to develop value collateral is to pick 3 or 4 problems that are common in your industry. 

Then create a well-designed PDF for each one of those problems. Let's discuss an example.

Here are 5 pieces of value collateral for a fictional sales coach. 

1. 5 Keys To Starting A Conversation With Your Dream Prospect
2. Why Your Prospects Aren't Calling You Back (And What To Do About It)
3. 7-Step Sales Process To 5x Your Pipeline Conversions
4. 5 Foolproof Cold Call Openers
5. The Only Voicemail Script You'll Ever Need 

Every one of these PDF's is highly valuable to this sales coach's audience. Each one of these PDF's goes right to the heart of the biggest problems that salespeople face on a regular basis.

**These PDF's (if they were real) would give real answers to these questions.** 

They would provide actual information that would help salespeople do their job better. 

These pieces of value collateral are essential to any outreach cadence. Why? Because without them, all you have to offer is a request. Think about that for a minute. If you have nothing to offer, what use are you? 

Value collateral turns all of your communication into pure value. The ask is incidental. 

### The Outreach Cadence

This system of offering value collateral works for any cadence. For our purposes, we will apply it to an outreach cadence for inviting guests onto your videocast. We'll keep using our fictional sales coach as an example. 

Start by connecting with a certain number of people on LinkedIn on Monday, say 25, for example. By Friday, most of the people who are going to connect with you will have connected. It will probably be 35% - 50% of the people you sent connection requests to. 

Once someone has connected with you, their contact information becomes available to you. You can see their email. This is important because not all of your touches are on LinkedIn, several of them are emails. If you only reach out on LinkedIn you will annoy people.

#### Touch #3 - Monday [Week Two] Email #1

	Subject line:  ☎ Your prospects aren't calling you back... do something about it

	Steve,

	Tell me if this sounds familiar. You spend several hours a day crafting emails, making cold-calls, leaving voicemails, sending LinkedIn messages. You pour your heart and soul into serving your prospects and what do you get for it? Crickets....

	It doesn't have to be this way. Here's a link to a quick guide on what you can do to actually start getting responses from your prospects - [insert link here].
	Take a look and see if any of this can make a difference for you. If it's not helpful, I'd love to hear why. I'm a sucker for an argument 😜

#### Touch #4 - Friday [Week Two] Email #2

	Subject Line: It's all fun and games until...

	Steve,

	Being in sales is a little bit like being a professional chef. There is constant pressure, if you mess up it's really obvious, people get REALLY frustrated when you get their order wrong, and you never know when you might accidentally chop off a finger (okay, that last one is just chefs).

	To make it worse, on top of all that grief, you have to make cold-calls! (dun, dun, DUN!!!)

	It's not the cold-calling that sucks, it's the mind-numbing fear of someone actually answering the phone when you do. 😉

	But seriously, cold-calls are a necessary evil and anything that can be done to make them more bearable is a good thing, right? 

	Here's a link to 5 foolproof cold call openers that will make your cold-calling more fun and way more likely to actually get a meeting. Here's the link - [insert link here].

	Let me know if any of these end up working for you!

#### Touch #6 - Friday [Week Three] Email

	Subject line: On a scale of 1 to "STOP CONTACTING ME"

	Steve,

	There are two kinds of people in the world. 

	1. People who mean to respond but forget. 

	2. People who never mean to respond and expect other people to get the hint. 

	I'm usually a #1 kind of person. If you're annoyed that I've been contacting you, sorry about that. Without some sort of response, I have no idea if you're person #1 or person #2.

	That being said, I'm still interested in having you on my show. It's about a 30-45 minute time commitment on your part. Nothing fancy, but it's a great opportunity to share your expertise and get some free exposure.

	If you're interested, let me know. If you're not interested, let me know that too. If no one responds to me I'm just assuming they mean to and forget. That's what happens to me anyway. 

	Thanks! 

	{Your Name}

## Growing Your Videocast

From here it's simply a matter of consistency. Rinse, repeat, rinse, and repeat again. The ideal is to be putting out one episode per week, and it's a good idea to be 2 or 3 weeks ahead of yourself. In other words, when you're recording interviews, they should be for an episode 3 weeks in the future. 

Finding guests seems daunting, but it's easier than you think. People like to have their ego stroked. Even high-profile thought-leaders are more willing than you would imagine to come on your show. 

Be bold and persistent in looking for guests and remember, it's all about the value you're bringing to your audience. 

You've got this!
