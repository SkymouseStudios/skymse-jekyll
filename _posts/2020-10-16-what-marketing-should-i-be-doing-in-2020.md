## What Marketing Should I Be Doing In 2020?

At this point, time flies at warp speed. I find myself reading articles from 2019 thinking, "Yeah, this is pretty much completely wrong now." It's possible this article will be on the 2021 scrap heap, but I'll do my best to write something a little longer-lasting. 

The reason most marketing information you find is outdated within 3 months is because it's tactical.  Tactics have the shortest life-cycle of any marketing information. No one reads *Ogilvy On Advertising* for the *tactics.* They read it for the principles.

Principles are forever. Principles are the foundation. Tactics are sand. Principles are cement. 

So many people are trying to figure out what kind of marketing they should be doing this year, next year, and the year after that. Here's the irony. You should be doing the same marketing that great marketers have always done. 

You should be branding.

## How Do I Brand Myself In 2020

You already have a brand, right now. If anyone thinks anything about you then you have a brand. Even if you're just "that guy I see in my connections sometimes but never talk to," you still have a brand. You're THAT guy.

The real question is how do I *intentionally* brand myself in 2020?

This is a more difficult question because you can't brand yourself until you understand something most people spend their entire lives trying to understand. Who are you?

### The Secret To Branding

The secret to branding is simple. Know who you are and communicate it to the market. Obviously, it's simple to say. Doing it is another thing entirely.

Everyone looks at branding from a "how-to" perspective. They're trying to understand the technical aspects of a brand. The only problem is branding is not a technical thing. It's an organic thing. A brand is a living organism because you are a living organism. 

Approaching branding from a technical perspective is like approaching gardening from an engineering perspective. You may technically grow some plants, but no one will ever accuse you of having a "green thumb."

The basis of your brand is you. This is an unchangeable fact. Any attempt to create a brand that is not a reflection of you will go as badly as planting a tomato and expecting to grow a strawberry. It won't work.  

### How Do I Find My Brand?

At the risk of sounding like a Shaolin Monk, you will find your brand when you discover who you are. I'm not kidding, and I'm not trying to sound profound. If you have a brand crisis, it's because you have an identity crisis. 

> “Regardless of WHAT we do in our lives, our WHY—our driving purpose, cause or belief—never changes.” - Simon Sinek

To find your brand, you need to ask yourself some questions:

1. What do I love doing? Why? 
2. If I could only do one thing for the rest of my life, what would it be? 
3. Why did I start my business?
4. Does the work we do for our customers fulfill me? If yes, why? If no, why?

Answering these questions will start you down the path of discovering who you are and why you do what you do. If you want to have a real brand, you must know the answers.

As you answer these questions, you will find more questions popping up. You will see other areas where you don't have clarity around your identity. Don't shy away from these questions. Wrestle with them, challenge yourself, and don't be afraid of the answers. 

## Branding Is The Most Important Marketing You Can  Do

Marketing in 2020 has become a nightmare of metrics. Businesses are trying to measure everything under the sun and make sure they can attribute every drop of revenue to some marketing activity or another.

Meanwhile, they're missing the forest for the trees. Ad clicks and website visits don't mean anything if there isn't a conversion. Branding is what makes conversions happen.  

[81% of consumers say they need to be able to trust a brand in order to buy from them](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/branding-statistics).

If you want purchases, you need a brand. If you want consumers to trust you and keep coming back, you need a brand.

If you're asking, "What marketing should I be doing?" the answer is simple. You should be building your brand.
