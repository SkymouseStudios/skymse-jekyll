## A Writer's Life For Me?

![A typewriter with coffe and a pen by it](/uploads/010-ballpoint-pen-classic-coffee-composition.jpg)

I hated writing.

I was home-schooled and I had a rigorous curriculum that tested the limits of my juvenile attention-span and willpower. My English classes included stories in which I was largely uninterested. I was interested in the reports and tests even less so.

But, in order to graduate high-school, I had to do the work. So I did, usually amid loud protestations as my mom would be glad to corroborate.

In college, it turned out that I was really glad my high-school literature classes were so grueling. I had become a decent writer during my time in the trenches.

When I graduated college and entered the professional world, I started writing on LinkedIn and for companies that employed me. I started getting feedback from people in my network and my jobs that I was a good writer. They enjoyed reading my articles.

If you had asked me a few years ago "are you a writer?", my answer would have been a resounding "NO." If you ask me now, the answer is a fairly confident "yes." I never aspired to be a writer. I never cared much whether I could write and I never saw writing as being a significant part of my professional life. Everything I know about writing was learned at some point. Just like you would learn how to make manicotti or play chess.

> If I can learn how to write, so can you.

If you're reading this post, its likely that you've realized how important blogging is to your digital marketing efforts. I'm going to share with you a simple and straightforward way to start writing blogs right now that draw search traffic and increase website conversions.

If you're reading this post and you haven't made that realization yet, read our post on **why blogging is the one marketing activity you can't ignore**.

## The Blog Paradox

The blog paradox is the idea that those who are the most qualified to write blogs for a company are  also the least likely to have the ability or the time to do so. Usually, a business owner or technical expert would be the best possible person to write a high-quality blog post.

In most cases, business owners do not have the time and highly technical people have a hard time writing in an engaging and easy to understand way.

This means that in most businesses, there are pages upon pages of potential blog posts waiting in the heads of business owners and technical experts that will never see the light of day. Why? Because those folks are caught in the blog paradox.

### The Writing Process

People who aren't writers think the writing process is some magical thing that only writers know. It's like an instinct or a vision that the rest of the world just doesn't have. This couldn't be further from the truth. The writing process is exactly that, a process.

> Any process can be learned, no innate ability or instincts required.

Most of us have done some sort of writing in our lives. Even if it was just book reports in high-school or that history final you barely passed in college.

What is the number one rule you learn in any literature class? **Start with an outline.**

### The Non-Writer's Guide To Outlines

I'm guessing when you read the word "outline" just now your eyelids started feeling very heavy. There are some words in the English language that are better than Tylenol PM when it comes to inducing sleep. Don't pass out on me, I'm going to share an outline process that will transform your blog writing.

It's simple and it works.

#### Step 1: Dictate

Dictating is the easiest way to create blog outlines. This can be done either with a recorder or with a person on your staff. I strongly recommend that you use a person on your staff, maybe someone on your marketing staff or your front-desk person.

When you dictate, you can simply share your thoughts on the topic about which you want to write. Think of it like stream of consciousness, but you can go back and remember everything you said perfectly.

This will begin sparking ideas and you will convey the information in a simple and clear way, like you're speaking to a prospect or a networking partner.

#### Step 2: Organize

Once you've done a brain dump, now you can organize that information into a clearly defined outline. I like groups of three a lot, which you will immediately if you read much of my writing. Find a way to group your information in 3's or 5's, this makes your post easier to skim through and find valuable pieces of information.

Check your points against the topic, that will help you find ways to group the information. For example, you might pick a topic like "How To Increase Your Sales Conversions By 30%". In this instance, take the information you dictated - either to a staff member or a voice recorder app - and find 3-5 ways that you can group the information.

Something like this:

* Tip #1 - Change Your Language
  * Use the word "you" and stop using "I"
  * Ask open ended questions and wait for a response
  * Stop saying "does that make sense?"
* Tip #2 - Be Intentional
  * Schedule your outreach
  * Have a reason for every touch
  * Offer value without any expectation of getting something back
* Tip #3 - Practice Empathy
  * Imagine you're reading your email as the recipient
  * Research your prospect's industry challenges
  * Protect their time for them

This kind of organization helps you clarify exactly what you're saying.

#### Step 3: Flush It Out

This last step is the part that you likely think of when you think of writing a blog post. This is where you add in the relevant information and build out the points. Here's the magic though. Considering you did the first two steps correctly, you've already done about 80% of the work. The hardest part is getting the information out of your head and organized, the easy part is putting in the details.

> You already know these like the back of your hand, that's why you're in business.

If you did steps 1 and 2 well, you'll have a 500-800 word outline created. From that you're just adding in the details and before you know it, you've got a 1,200 - 1,500 word blog post.

## Make The Information Accessible

The most important part of writing a blog is making complicated topics easy to understand. The reason your prospects can't do what you do is because they don't know what you know. You've been running your business for 5, 10, 15 or more years.

> This means you have tons of information that helps you do what you do so well.

The secret to writing high-impact, high-conversion blog posts is to **teach your prospects how to solve their problems without you.** In order for them to be able to do this, they have to understand exactly how to do the things you do.

This is where most blog posts fall short. In an attempt to make the blog easy to read, they fail to deliver actionable and relevant information. Lucky for you, I have a foolproof method for making complex information easy to understand.

### You Need Feedback

![Smiley faces on a chaulk board](010-rating-system.jpg)

Earlier in the post I mentioned that it's better to dictate to a staff member than a recorder.  The reason is because when you dictate to a staff member, you can tell them to ask you a question every time you say something they don't understand. This is also why it's more useful to use someone who doesn't have great awareness of the inner-workings of what you do. This is usually someone like your finance person or your receptionist.

Sit down with this person, whoever it may be, and start dictating your blog ideas to them and tell them to take thorough notes. Then, every time they ask you a question, answer it until they clearly understand what you're saying and have them write it down in the format that makes sense to them.

This is a very powerful way to create easy to understand blog posts while still sharing detailed, complex information.

### DIY Blog Posts

Blogging is critical for website traffic and conversions. If you do nothing else for your marketing efforts, blog. It's the cheapest and most effective way for small businesses to market themselves.

Using this process to create your blogs will generate posts that attract traffic and convince them to buy from you.

Good luck!
