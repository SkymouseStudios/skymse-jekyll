## Why Use Infographics?

When it comes to SEO, there isn't much more useful than infographics. 

Articles featuring infographics received [over 170% more links](https://venngage.com/blog/infographic-statistics/) than other standard articles. 

Since links are arguably the best way to increase your search rankings, infographics need to be at the top of your content priority list. 

If you start incorporating infographics into your blogs posts, your blogs will become more engaging, they will garner more organic search traffic, and they will generate backlinks for your domain.

## How To Use Infographics

Infographics are most useful as additions to your content. Don't think of infographics as content for your blog post. They augment your words and increase the value of your posts, but they don't substitute for words. Especially in blogging, **word count still matters.** 

## Blogging Infographics 2020

### Ideal Blog Length

<img class="blog-image-mid" src="/uploads/026-blog-length.png" alt="ideal blog length">

It's one of the most common questions in the blogging world. "How long should my posts be?"

Thanks to our friends over at Hook Agency, we know that that [the ideal length for a blog post is 1,760 words](https://hookagency.com/blog-length/). 

Use this infographic to spice up your SEO articles or make your social media posts shine. 

### Average Blog Length

<img class="blog-image-mid" src="/uploads/026-blog-details.png" alt="blog details make blogs longer">

With the ideal blog length being 1,760 words, it gets really interesting to know that only 18% of companies write blogs over 750 words. 

The most important thing to know is that just because there are a lot of bloggers out there, it doesn't mean they're all doing what they need to be to drive traffic. 

Use this infographic to make your case for why blogging is not as competitive as people think. 4 out 5 blogs are not writing posts long enough to offer competition if you're willing to put in the work and do it right. 

### Ideal Blog Title Length

<img class="blog-image-mid" src="/uploads/027-3-ideal-blog-title-length.png" alt="ideal blog title length">

Blog titles are another common question in the blogosphere. Your titles should be between 11-14 words. 

The best way to get your title length to where it should be is to use a main title and a subtitle.

For example: "Blog infographics 2020: 7 Infographics To Take Your Blogs To The Next Level" 

Using this kind of title format helps you increase your title length and entice readers with your irresistible content. 

### Blog Reader Attention Span

<img class="blog-image-full" src="/uploads/026-blog-time.png" alt="Time people spend reading blogs">

This is an interesting statistic because many people think that this means you shouldn't bother writing long-form blogs anymore. 

The reality is that the average time spent reading blog posts is more about the relevance of blogs than about blog readers not sticking around on a page.

Just reference your own experience. You read long-form posts right? We all love finding that nice 2,000 word post that details exactly what we're looking for.

That's the trick though, people only read for a few seconds when the post is not what they are looking for. 

Use this infographic to make a case for niching down on your blog posts. Blog readers are looking for very specific answers to very specific questions. Don't paint with broad strokes, focus down. 

### Ideal Reading Time For A Blog

<img class="blog-image-mid" src="/uploads/027-5-ideal-reading-time.png" alt="ideal blog reading time">

This supports the reality of long-form blog posts. A 7-minute read is somewhere between 1,500 and 2,500 words, depending on the reader. Let's just say it's 2,000 words on average. 

This coincides nicely with the ideal length of a post being 1,760 words. Reading time has more to do with reader engagement and word count has more to do with Google's ranking factors.

However, the two are closely tied. After 7 minutes, readers are going to get bored, even if they're interested in your blog topic. 

Use this infographic to teach the real lesson here. Which is that the law of diminishing returns really kicks in when you start writing blog posts that are too long. 

### Blog Lead Gen

<img class="blog-image-mid" src="/uploads/027-6-leads-from-blogs.png" alt="blogs generate 9 times the number of leads as short posts">

Again, another score for the long-form blog post. Long-form posts generate 9 times the number of leads as short-form posts.

Most people think of long-form as anything over 1,000 words. If you make it your commitment to never write a post less than 1,000 words, you'll be off to a good start. 

Again, keep in mind that the ideal post length is a little over 1,500 words, but that doesn't have to be the case for every post. 

Use this infographic to make the case for never writing a sub-1,000 word blog post again. 

### Consumer Behavior

<img class="blog-image-mid" src="/uploads/027-8-blog-frequency.png" alt="ideal blog title length">

The whole point of blogging is to create new business right? Obviously, you're blogging because you want to help and educate others, but you need to eat, so you need to make money. 

This infographic sums up the reality of content marketing. No matter how you shake it, when a customer comes to you and asks for help, itâ€™s a best case scenario. It's the whole reason for blogging in the first place. 

Businesses spend thousands of dollars on advertisements when their content is more powerful and more appealing to customers. 

Use this infographic to show the power of content marketing. 

### Blogging Infographic 2020

Individual infographics are nice and everything, but sometimes, you just want the whole enchilada. ðŸŒ¯

This infographic is a collection of all the infographics above, put into a format to be used as one image.

Use this infographic for general purpose blogging articles or to share on social media to show how cool and hip you are. 

## Are Infographics Still Relevant?

At this point, I hope you can see how valuable infographics are. They work really well in blog articles, on social media, and as content on your website. 

Creating your own infographics can be challenging, but it's totally worth it. The amount of engagement, backlinks, and SEO juice you can get from infographics is really amazing.
