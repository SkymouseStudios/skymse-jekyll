## So what are the best apps for business owners?
The landscape of apps is changing quickly. Here's the apps we like to use here at Skymouse how we use them. 

We also added in some alternatives, if you are looking for something different or don't like an app for some reason.

## 1. Use Evernote for keeping all of your information accessible
As a business owner, you have alot to keep track of. Evernotes is a place for all your information, brainstorming and whatnot. Evernote's been around a while, so you've probably heard about it.

Keep notes about your business model, customer profiles, people who might want to invest and organize with tags like `person` for living documents about potential clients, or a `agenda` tag so you can quickly see all the notes.

Here are some of the top features in Evernote
- Organize in Stacks > Notebooks > Notes
- Organize with tags
- Sync between computer, web browser, ipad, iphone etc
- I LOVE the top bar note taker, I use it every day, makes taking notes on the go super quick
- Share notes and notebooks with other members of your team or clients

I'll be honest I've been using this for a while, so there may be a better option. I've been messing around in Boostnote recently.

We use it for meeting notes, client notes, research and it's where we start our blogposts. We do alot of sorting with our tags. I'm going to publish a post about evernote in the next couple weeks, so subscribe to make sure you don't miss it!

What's new in Evernote 2018:
They just added templates, which is a sweet way to get started quicly and standardize some of your information.

Warning: Evernote is only useful if you create a system on how to use it. It also works way better if you use for everything. So for us, we don't use work docs for internal purposes, we put it all into Evernote. 

Some of the other downsides of the free version is that you can only sync 2 devices at a time.

Alternate apps to Evernote
- BoostNote
- Dropbox Paper
- Onenote
- Google Keep

## 2. Automate all your repetative tasks with Zapier
Zapier may be my favorite app of all. It's really quite amazing. You can get started way easier when they let you make 5 zaps for free! I can promise that your life will never be the same.

You can automate pretty much everything besides spending quality time with your kids. (That's something you should probably do in person.)

Some of my favorite Zaps include:
- When I post instagram picture *then* post it as an actual picture in Twitter (Not just the link)
- When I get a new subscriber in Mailchimp, *then* add them to Hubspot as a new contact
- When someone fills out a form in Airtable (more on this later) send me an alert in Slack

The possiblities are endless and when ever moment counts, Zapier will definiley help cut out the mumbo jumbo.

The only downside is that it may be a bit confusing if you don't document your automations. (I keep an evernote note of Automations so I know how things are behaving.)

What's new in Zapier
IF/Then logic has been added so you can add conditional logic to your automations! This is a big deal when you want automations to happen only in certain situations.

Alternates to automating your apps
- IFTTT (completely free)
- Tray.io


## 3. Send great looking email to a lot of people with MailChimp
MailChimp may be one of the more popular apps out there for marketers.The best part: Use Mailchimp for free if your list isn't too big.

Here are some examples of what makes Mailchimp great:
- create `groups` and `segments` in Mailchimp so you customers get what they need and only what they need.
- quickly design your own email templates, so you aren't repeating yourself
- automate when people get emails, like when they sign-up, have a birthday, or leave your list. It's awesome.
- design pop-ups and other ways of capturing emails from your website or social media accounts
- add tags to subscribers automatically after they've finished a drip campaign

When to not use Mailchimp: If you are doing a lot of cold sales emails, Mailchimp is not for you. They are pretty strict about getting your suscribers to sign up for your emails directly and you can get your account shut down if you upload a bunch of emails without making sure it's a good list of people.

New Features in MailChimp 2018
Mailchimp is really good about growing their service expanding capabilites. You can now create landing pages in MailChimp, organize your contacts with Tags, and connect you Ecommerce store effortlessly.

Alternatives to MailChimp
- Active Campaign
- Campagin Monitor
- Intercom

## 4. Track your projects like a pro with Asana
I've been using Asana for about 2 years now and it's great. They've also added some new features, so it's an app that keeps on giving. The free version of the app is highly functional and great for even very large projects.

Some of our favorite features in Asana
- create different organizations/Workspaces and quickly move between them
- Board view makes it easy to know your project status exactly
- they have list view
- assign tasks to other users
- timeline view shows the progress of the whole project, as well as task dependencies.

How to use Asana in the workplace
- We've created a project for each client and manage a board view so we know the status of each client immiediatley.
- We have internal projects like our website, social media, and a SkyDev project so we don't fall behind on those
- We can invite clients to their project so they can also upload documents, finish their tasks and see the project status

When not to use Asana
What I've found in Asana is that it can get really confusing really quick. Especially if you have a large project or a couple of large projects. Smaller teams might struggle to make sure projects are updated and that people don't fall out of using it.

I would suggest using it in a lighter form and really keeping tasks light, as much as you might want to make a task for every single detail of a project, this can also be overwelming and unecessary for alot of people.

Some other ways of managing your projects beside Asana
- Monday
- Trello
- Airtable

## 5. Communicate sans-email with your team on Slack
Email gets really sloppy and is a pain in the neck for a lot of people. Slack has quicly become a suber popular way of communicating in all sorts of groups.

We like it a lot and it's made life easy

Slack has a ton of power, here are just a few of the capabilites
- Quicly switch between organizations througout the day. (i.e. we are on one of our clients slack orgs and it makes communicating awesome)
- Create an Evernote from within Slack Great integration!
- create social media alerts that show up in slack
- create tasks in asana from slack.
- calendar alerts should show up in slack.
- create new calendar events in slack
- get an alert in Slack when we get a new lead in Salesforce

Why Slack could also be a terrible idea
Slack is addicting and it can be distracting as a commercial during the superbowl. People can quickly start using the private messaging version instead of being out in the open in channels, which defeats the purpose of channels in a lot of ways.

I recommend setting times in your day to mute slack so it doesn't bring you out of work mode and ruin your flow.


Some alternatives to Slack
- Microsoft Teams (inlcuded in Office 365 Subscription )

## 6. Buffer
I've been using Buffer for almost 2 years now. Not only do I like the app but I've come to appreciate the company behind the app. They have some cool pricipals and their blog is also pretty great.

I've talked to alot of people and there are a lot of preferences out there when it comes to soclial media schduleing. We use Buffer for our clients, ourselves and I use it for my personal account.

- Schedule social media posts
- Track new feeds of things
- All you analytics in one place
- easily integrate your own short URL for your links(i.e. skymse.com)
- The mobile app makes scheduling on the go super easy.

You probably shouldn't use buffer if...
The social media work is an echo chamber of recycled information. WHile buffer is a good tool, it's only as good as the content that you're sharing. So be original focus on creating awesome content. That't where the real magic happens.

Buffer also doesn't take the place of live interaction. Engaging with your followers and fans works best when you're in the native medium and can make the difference in how people perceive your brand.

What's new
You can now post to instagram automatically! (Previously you could only schedule reminders to post). You can also now add emojis straight from buffer.

Alternatives to Buffer for social media
- Sprout Social
- Hootsuite

## 7. Organize and view data like never befor in Airtable
Airtable is the most recent addition to our arsenal of apps. It's basically google sheets with way more functionality and more simplicity. Counter-intutive? Nope. They actually did it.

Much of the projects we work on only make so much sense to be stored as a document. Some information is really more like data and should be treated as such.

Some examples of what you can do in Airtable
- Create online forms
- plan your social media calendar
- track employee or client feedback
- keep all your client testimonials in one place

Some of our favorite quailites about Aitable
- See record history on your fields! (So if someone deletes something, it's still there)
- easily manage "base" permissions with clients and other staff
- embed and share your tables
- Switch how you see your data with the click of a mouse with the `views` functionality

There really aren't many downsides to Airtable to be honest. The paid version has a ton of additional fuctionality using their `Airtable Blocks`

Alternatives to Airtable
- Google Sheets

## 8. Keep you contacts all in one place and grow your business with Hubspot
A CRM is the best way to track sales and your client life cycle. At Skymouse we track our deals using Hubspot as well a couple other features that make life easier.

Many businesses and sale people hate CRMs and spend alot of time and money on software they never use.

Why you should be using a CRM like Hubspot.
- A CRM is essential to making sure you're focusing on the right projects at the right time
- Keep notes on clients and prospects right in the app so you don't repeat yourself and look foolish
- Know exactly how much money is in your sales pipeline

Agian, you don't have to go crazy with your information, just keep it up to date, and use it enough so that you know who you are going after and when to go after them.

- multiple users can share information and data about your clients, prospects and leads
- Add a chat window to your websites
- Send emails directly to clients from without Hubspot
- Create forms to capture leads on your website
- Keep track of all your contacts and companies while easily linking them together as needed

Alternatives to Hubspot
- salesforce
- Drift
- Pipedrive
- Airtable

## 9. Track your team's time with Harvest
This is also a new one for me, I had been previously using toggle.

Something Harvest taught me was how to think of my time in terms of the value. If I'm doing business development, vs. web development vs. a call with a client, I've become way  more conscious of how I spend my time. I'm tracking my time this very moment. So meta.

- browser, phone, computer apps to make tracking time accessible
- apply viaried billable rates based on the type of task you're working on.
- if you've been inactive on your computer for an extended amout of time, Harvest will catch it and ask if you want to stop the timer and roll back the time.
- generate invoices for your clients from right within harvest
- integrate with your accounting app (Quickbooks has a native integration, we use Wave for account, so I integrated that via Zapier)

When Harvest may not be for you.
The free version is pretty limited, you can only have two projects. I upgraded because tracking my time is really important to me and how we serve our clients

It also integrates with Asana right in the app!

Alternatives to Harvest
- Toggl (The free version of this may be a better start if you have alot of projects.)

## Bonus: Read things later with Pocket
Chances are you read a lot. It's not always the best time to read though, the way I solve this: Pocket. I'll get email newslettters with links to new articles, my dad might text me an article he found, our I'll see some intresting blogs on the internet.

I'll save them quickly with pocket and be on my way. That way I can come back later and do all my reading when I'm ready for it. 

Hopefully I can find a relaxing environment where I can focus and perhaps take some notes if something is particularly usefull.

- organize your articles with tags
- the browser plugin lets you save for later with one click
- the app on iPad syncs everything I saved on my computer
- there is an awesome dark mode for reading in the dark without frying your eyes.
- you can also save videos for later!

## Free apps are awesome, but....
Here are some additional thoughts when working with free apps.

I would really encourage you that if you like an app and can afford it, to pay for the next version. Chances are it will provide value to you and you are also supporting the great developers behind these apps.

These apps are created by talented teams that rely on people paying for it, so we should support them if we can and once we are really benefiting from their services.

While I think apps are great for doing business in the business universe of 2018, here are a couple tips to keep things in check:

- Document how YOU use apps. Make it clear to your internal team what is acceptable and what is not
- Adoption can be slow, so take time to really get used to the app
- The fewer apps, the better. Don't get too "App Happy" Keep things simple and effective

I also included some noteworthy alternatives to each app, because not every app is perfect. Sometimes you one app works better for your needs. 

I am also aware that there are other apps out there, I'd be happy to hear any suggestions if you have any! Just tweet me @thePatrickHanus.
