## So what are the most useful apps for business owners?

Much like the 10pc Mauviel 6530.06 M'Heritage M250C 2.5mm Copper Cookware Set would be a lovely addition to my kitchen and beef up my cooking capabilities, there are loads of apps out there helping you cook up a business that you're proud of.

That being said, the landscape of apps is changing quickly. Here's the apps we like to use at Skymouse, and how we use them, and something new that might make you reconsider some of these apps that have been around a while.

We also suggest some alternatives if you are looking for something different.

## 1. Use Evernote for keeping all of your information accessible.

As a business owner, you have a lot to track. Evernote can assist you in this task.

Keep notes about your business model, customer profiles, and any ideas for cups, mugs, shirts and futons with your logo on it. Evernote helps you keep track of people who might want to invest in your business and  "tag" them with labels, providing you with pertinent information at a glance.

### Here are some of the things Evernote allows you to do:

* Organize in Stacks > Notebooks > Notes
* Organize with tags.
* Sync between computer, web browser, ipad, iphone, etc.
* Take notes on the go...I LOVE the **top bar note taker**—I use it every day.
* Share notes and notebooks with other members of your team or with your clients.

At Skymouse, we use Evernote for meeting notes, notes about what our clients needs are, and research. We do a lot of sorting with our tags and _(here you might want to give an example. Your original draft had some examples in the first paragraph, but I got rid of it._) I'm going to publish a post about Evernote which will....in the next couple weeks, so subscribe to make sure you don't miss it! _(what will make that post different from this one? Maybe "teach you how to use Evernote systematically and effectively" or something even more specific that will benefit your reader._

### What's new in Evernote 2018? 

They just added templates which is a sweet way to get started quickly and standardize some of your information.

### A word of warning

Evernote is only useful if you use it systematically. It also works way better if you use for everything. So for us, we don't use work docs for internal purposes, we put it all into Evernote. _(I don't understand that last line. Actually I am a little fuzzy on the whole paragraph and what it really means.)_

You should also be aware that with the free version of the Evernote app you can only sync 2 devices at a time. _(You could just mention this on your bulleted list above when you mention its features.)_

### Alternates to Evernote

* BoostNote
* Dropbox Paper
* Onenote
* Google Keep

## 2. Automate all your repetitive tasks with Zapier.

Zapier may be my favorite app of all. It's really quite amazing. Zapier let you make 5 "Zaps" for free, so it makes getting started easy! I can promise that your life will never be the same.

Using Zapier, you can automate pretty much everything in your life besides spending quality time with your kids. (That's something you should probably do in person.)

_(I need to talk to you about these bullet points.)_

### Some of my favorite Zaps

* When I post instagram picture _then_ post it as an actual picture in Twitter (Not just the link)
* When I get a new subscriber in Mailchimp, _then_ add them to Hubspot as a new contact
* When someone fills out a form in Airtable (more on this later) send me an alert in Slack

The possibilities are endless and when every moment counts in the business day, Zapier will definitely help cut out the piddling around.

The only downside about using Zapier is that it may be a bit confusing if you don't document your automations. I keep track of Automations in Evernote and have no problems related to automations.

What's new in Zapier? IF/Then logic allows you to add conditional logic to your automations! This is a big deal when you want automations to take place only in certain situations.

### Alternates to Zapier

* IFTTT (completely free)
* Tray.io

## 3. Send great looking email to a lot of people with MailChimp.

MailChimp may be one of the more popular apps out there for marketers.The best part— use Mailchimp for free if your list isn't too big.

I use Mailchimp all the time. It may be used in order to:

* create `groups` and `segments` in Mailchimp so your customers get what they need and only what they need
* quickly design your own email templates, so you aren't repeating yourself
* automate when people get emails, like when they sign-up, have a birthday, or leave your list. (Awesome.)
* design pop-ups and other ways of capturing emails from your website or social media accounts.
* add tags to subscribers automatically after they've finished a drip campaign.

What's new in MailChimp 2018? Mailchimp is really good about growing their service expanding capabilites. You can now create landing pages in MailChimp, organize your contacts with Tags, and connect you Ecommerce store effortlessly.

Note: If you are doing a lot of cold sales emails, Mailchimp is not for you. They are pretty strict about getting your subscribers to sign up for your emails directly. You account might be shut down if you upload a bunch of emails without making sure it's a good list of people. _(Might want to specify what makes it "good?")_

### Alternates to Mailchimp

* Active Campaign
* Campagin Monitor
* Intercom

## 4. Track your projects like a pro with Asana

I've been using Asana for about 2 years now and it's great. They've also added some new features, so it's an app that keeps on giving. The free version of the app is highly functional and works well even for very large projects.

### Asana allows you to...

* create different organizations/workspaces and quickly move between them.
* ascertain your project status through **Board View**.
* _???_ list view
* assign tasks to other users.
* view a timeline progression of the whole project, as well as task dependencies.

### How to use Asana in the workplace:

* We've created a **project** for each client and manage a **board view** so we know the status of each client at all times.
* We have internal projects like our website, social media, and a SkyDev project so we don't fall behind.
* We can invite clients to their **project** so they can also upload documents, finish their tasks, and see the project status.

Note: What I've found in Asana is that it can get confusing really quick. Especially if you have a large project or a couple of large projects. Smaller teams might struggle to make sure projects are updated and that people are using it effectively.

I would suggest keeping tasks basic and simple. As much as you might be tempted to make a task for every single detail of a project, over-planning can be overwelming and unnecessary.

### Alternates to Asana

* Monday
* Trello
* Airtable

## 5. Communicate sans-email with your team on Slack.

Email gets really sloppy and is a pain in the neck for a lot of people. Slack has quickly become a super popular way of communicating in all sorts of groups.

We like it a lot, and it's made life easier at Skymouse!

### How to use Slack in the workplace

* Quickly switch between organizations throughout the day.
* Create an Evernote from within Slack. Great integration!
* Create social media alerts that show up in Slack.
* Create tasks in Asana from Slack.
* Establish calendar alerts and create new calendar events.
* get an alert in Slack when we get a new lead in Salesforce. _(Who is "we." Sould it be assumed that your reader knows what this phrase is referring to in general?)_

Note: Slack could be a terrible idea. Slack is addicting, and it can be distracting as a commercial during the superbowl. _(I don't find this to be a good analogy.)_ Some people start using the private messaging version instead of being out in the open in channels, which defeats the purpose of channels in a lot of ways. _(This paragraph might need reworking--it isn't clear to me.)_

I recommend setting times in your day to mute Slack so it doesn't bring you out of work mode and ruin your flow.

### Alternatives to Slack

* Microsoft Teams (included in Office 365 Subscription )

## 6. Buffer

I've been using Buffer for almost 2 years now. Not only do I like the app but I've come to appreciate the company behind the app. They have some cool principals and their blog is also pretty great.

I've talked to a lot of people and there are a lot of preferences out there when it comes to social media scheduling. We use Buffer for our clients, ourselves and I use it for my personal account.

* Schedule social media posts
* Track new feeds of things
* All you analytics in one place
* easily integrate your own short URL for your links(i.e. skymse.com)
* The mobile app makes scheduling on the go super easy.

### You probably shouldn't use buffer if... 

The social media work is an echo chamber of recycled information. While buffer is a good tool, it's only as good as the content that you're sharing. So be original focus on creating awesome content. That't where the real magic happens.

Buffer also doesn't take the place of live interaction. Engaging with your followers and fans works best when you're in the native medium and can make the difference in how people perceive your brand.

What's new
You can now post to instagram automatically! (Previously you could only schedule reminders to post). You can also now add emojis straight from buffer.

Alternatives to Buffer for social media

* Sprout Social
* Hootsuite

## 7. Organize and view data like never before in Airtable

Airtable is the most recent addition to our arsenal of apps. It's basically google sheets with way more functionality and more simplicity. Counter-intuitive? Nope. They actually did it.

Much of the projects we work on only make so much sense to be stored as a document. Some information is really more like data and should be treated as such.

Some examples of what you can do in Airtable

* Create online forms
* plan your social media calendar
* track employee or client feedback
* keep all your client testimonials in one place

Some of our favorite qualities about Airtable

* See record history on your fields! (So if someone deletes something, it's still there)
* easily manage "base" permissions with clients and other staff
* embed and share your tables
* Switch how you see your data with the click of a mouse with the `views` functionality

There really aren't many downsides to Airtable to be honest. The paid version has a ton of additional functionality using their `Airtable Blocks`

Alternatives to Airtable

* Google Sheets

## 8. Keep you contacts all in one place and grow your business with HubSpot CRM

A CRM is the best way to track sales and your client life cycle. At Skymouse we track our deals using HubSpot as well a couple other features that make life easier.

Many businesses and sale people hate CRMs and spend a lot of time and money on software they never use.

Why you should be using a CRM like HubSpot.

* A CRM is essential to making sure you're focusing on the right projects at the right time
* Keep notes on clients and prospects right in the app so you don't repeat yourself and look foolish
* Know exactly how much money is in your sales pipeline

Again, you don't have to go crazy with your information, just keep it up to date, and use it enough so that you know who you are going after and when to go after them.

* multiple users can share information and data about your clients, prospects and leads
* Add a chat window to your websites
* Send emails directly to clients from without HubSpot
* Create forms to capture leads on your website
* Keep track of all your contacts and companies while easily linking them together as needed

### Alternatives to HubSpot

* salesforce
* Drift
* Pipedrive
* Airtable

## 9. Track your team's time with Harvest

This is also a new one for me, I had been previously using toggle.

Something Harvest taught me was how to think of my time in terms of the value. If I'm doing business development, vs. web development vs. a call with a client, I've become way  more conscious of how I spend my time. I'm tracking my time this very moment. So meta.

* browser, phone, computer apps to make tracking time accessible
* apply varied billable rates based on the type of task you're working on.
* if you've been inactive on your computer for an extended amount of time, Harvest will catch it and ask if you want to stop the timer and roll back the time.
* generate invoices for your clients from right within harvest
* integrate with your accounting app (Quickbooks has a native integration, we use Wave for account, so I integrated that via Zapier)

### When Harvest may not be for you. 

### The free version is pretty limited, you can only have two projects. I upgraded because tracking my time is really important to me and how we serve our clients

It also integrates with Asana right in the app!

Alternatives to Harvest

* Toggl (The free version of this may be a better start if you have alot of projects.)

## Bonus: Read things later with Pocket

Chances are you read a lot. It's not always the best time to read though, the way I solve this: Pocket. I'll get email newslettters with links to new articles, my dad might text me an article he found, our I'll see some intresting blogs on the internet.

I'll save them quickly with pocket and be on my way. That way I can come back later and do all my reading when I'm ready for it.

Hopefully I can find a relaxing environment where I can focus and perhaps take some notes if something is particularly usefull.

* organize your articles with tags
* the browser plugin lets you save for later with one click
* the app on iPad syncs everything I saved on my computer
* there is an awesome dark mode for reading in the dark without frying your eyes.
* you can also save videos for later!

## Free apps are awesome, but....

Here are some additional thoughts when working with free apps.

I would really encourage you that if you like an app and can afford it, to pay for the next version. Chances are it will provide value to you and you are also supporting the great developers behind these apps.

These apps are created by talented teams that rely on people paying for it, so we should support them if we can and once we are really benefiting from their services.

While I think apps are great for doing business in the business universe of 2018, here are a couple tips to keep things in check:

* Document how YOU use apps. Make it clear to your internal team what is acceptable and what is not
* Adoption can be slow, so take time to really get used to the app
* The fewer apps, the better. Don't get too "App Happy" Keep things simple and effective

I also included some noteworthy alternatives to each app, because not every app is perfect. Sometimes you one app works better for your needs.

I am also aware that there are other apps out there, I'd be happy to hear any suggestions if you have any! Just tweet me @thePatrickHanus.
