## What is a brand?

> “A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories, and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another. - Seth Godin

This is Seth Godin’s definition of a brand. Does this sound like something that is easily measured? Does this sound like something you would call “scientific?”

So, why are so many marketers spending most of their time chasing metrics, performance marketing, and “lead-generation?” 

The answer is simple, they’ve allowed the market to tell them how to do their job.

### Marketers have lost sight of their purpose

Most [CEO’s have decided that marketing is the primary driver of revenue](https://marketinginsidergroup.com/strategy/cmo-revenue-growth/) in their business. 

<img class="blog-image-mid" src="/uploads/032-quote.jpeg" alt="nearly 70 percent of ceos believe cmos should be leading revenue growth">

While it is true that marketing should heavily influence revenue, this hyper-focus on tying marketing results to metrics and revenue is causing marketers to lose their identity. Many marketers are smart and capable, but they’re spending their time on the wrong things and allowing themselves to be judged by the wrong standards. 

> “The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself.” - Peter Drucker

Many business leaders think of marketing as some kind of golden goose for business growth. If they just put in money, out comes new business.  

This isn’t how marketing works. There is a craft to marketing and it cannot simply be boiled down to inputs and outputs. 

### Marketing is an art

Marketing is an art, like woodworking or painting. There are always objective rules and techniques that you must learn, but the end results are unique and are often unpredictable. 

The problem with turning marketing into a data science is all opportunity for practicing the craft of marketing is lost. 

The real craft of marketing is understanding customer attention. Marketing is more about connecting a solution to a need than it is about driving revenue. Revenue is a result, not a goal, in marketing. 

When Google Analytics becomes the only measure of marketing effectiveness, huge portions of marketing activities are left off the table. 

Marketers who understand the soft metrics are becoming the exception, not the rule. Soft metrics include things like communicating emotionally, capturing attention, and building an audience. 

These types of marketing activities are how businesses build a brand and grow their reach. When marketers treat marketing as an art, they begin focusing on the customer, not their marketing. This shift creates better messaging, advertising, and ultimately, sales. 

### How to measure marketing

The goal of marketing is not revenue. Revenue is a result, not a goal. 

The goal of marketing is connection. The goal is reach. The goal is emotional attachment. When these things are accomplished, revenue happens. 

Marketers need to recapture their purpose and stop allowing non-marketers to tell them how to measure their goals. The purpose of marketing is to communicate, not drive revenue. 

The art of marketing means sharing your product and service with the market in a way that communicates exactly why your audience needs it and what it’s going to do for them. 

If you’ve been trying to market your business using performance marketing and metric-driven activities that aren’t working, think about changing your approach. Marketing can be the thing that grows your business, but only if you treat it like marketing, not some magical revenue-generating genie.
