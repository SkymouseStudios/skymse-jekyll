Write an article on how I use asana to keep my inbox clean and empty.

Everyone has their own methodology, this is mine. Feel free to give this a shot.

Email is the worst. Its messy, confusing and gets out of hand really quick. I think one of the best ways to shoot your productivity in the leg is working out of your email. The idea of using email as a to-do list is stupid.

Check  your email as infrequently as possible. If you must do it, do it at a designated time, like once an hour or whatever. Just try to keep it as a menial task that is done to waste time. Going through email has nothing to do with getting things done. It is a waste of time,

Things I need to do now or later. (Tasks and Project related information/files)
->Send to Asana (This will maintain attachments!) This is also where prioritization takes place.

Things I want to read later. (Blogs and newsletters.)
->Send to Pocket (read when I can focus, absorb and take notes)

Information and things I want to hold onto forever. (Pictures, files, conversations)
->Send to Evernote (Usually ends up being just thoughts and ideas)

Nip alerts in the bud. (Automate alerts to a channel on slack)
->Send to Slack (things like newsletters that can just be RSS feeds, twitter/social media alerts, 

Once it has been processed correctly, I archive it or delete it so it still exists if I need to search for things. The ideal result is to have inbox zero most of the time.

The Danger
The trap to fall into is to become obsessed with cleaning and sorting your inbox. This is bad. email is and always will be a waste of time. The goal is to spend as little time in your inbox as humanly possible. What I’m doing now is checking my inbox at the end of a block of work time. So turn off email alerts and notifications, so that you work distraction-free for 50-minute (you can also do longer, whatever system works for you) blocks and the ten minute break in between where you check on the email, update your status in Asana, get a drink of water and reset to move on to the next project.

Prioritize like its your Job. Because it is.
The biggest problem with email is that it throws a brick in your smooth prioritization system. It can quickly pull you out of something much more important and urgent, simply because your brain loves distraction. Once someone asks a question or asks something of you you should add it to Asana and see how it matches up against the rest of your tasks. Think of it like a ticket system, and the more important tickets are going to get more love and Asana helps you make sure you do that. If you want to get to a task in a couple days, you can add a due date and make sure you have your reminder alerts set to ping you on the right day.

Slack + Asana
One thing I like about this is that I have a channel set up for each project, so I can scroll through and see a chain of the work, completed tasks, and comments regarding the projects. A nice little digital trail. This is especially nice if you are working with a team or assigning projects to people.

Other Ideas
Unsubscribe immediately from emails you don’t want to get like coupons newsletters, or flyers, and send them to a folder so you can look at them on an as-needed basis, rather than having to sort through them on a reoccurring pattern.
