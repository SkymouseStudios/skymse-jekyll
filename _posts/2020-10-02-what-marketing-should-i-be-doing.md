There are many videos just like this one on the internet right now. This video gives ideas for ways you can market your business in 2020. This video isn’t bad and it has some good points on ways businesses can leverage digital marketing.

The challenge for businesses is that there are so many marketing companies sharing information on how to market their business, but none of them are teaching businesses what it means to market their business.

Tactical marketing tactics are useful when you are sharing a coherent message with the right audience. Those last two pieces are a big caveat because very few businesses know their message and even fewer know their audience. 

### What is marketing?

Marketing means a lot of different things to different people. Are all these ideas right? 

> “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” 
> — Maya Angelou

I love this quote because it defines marketing in it’s simplest terms. 

Marketing is an emotion. **The difference between a brand and a business is a feeling.** 

### What marketing should I be doing?

The answer is simple, do marketing that works. What does that mean?

Your first goal in marketing is to create an emotional attachment with your audience. The only way to build an emotional attachment is to identify which area of human survival and thriving your product or service affects. 

Then, tie your product or service to that need. This sounds abstract, but there isn’t a better way to say it. The kind of marketing that you should be doing depends on what you do. There are lots of business looking for the marketing “silver bullet.” What works for one business may not work for another business. 

The best way to determine the kind of marketing you should be doing is to ask yourself two questions:

1. Where are my customers?
2. Who are my customers? 

### How to find my customers

> “The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.“ - Simon Sinek

Most marketing fails because it’s backwards. Instead of saying what they believe and waiting for their audience to show up, businesses try to identify their audience and then say what they think they want to hear. 

This is fundamentally flawed because **the buying process starts with shared belief.** There are very few business willing to accept this premise, but it is the foundation of all marketing and even all business growth. 

It is impossible to sustainably grow a business if your focus is always on the transaction and never on the person making the transaction. Your customers are not people who need what you have. Your customers are people who believe what you believe. When you understand this and begin to share your beliefs, your customers will reveal themselves to you. 

Once your audience reveals themselves, you will have the answer to your two questions. When you know who your audience is, it means you have created a brand identity and it resonates with a specific person. When you know where your audience is, it means you can reach them predictably and consistently. These two things are vital to any marketing efforts.

### Where do I start marketing?

Marketing is an organic process. Nobody gets it right the first time. It takes time, patience, and resilience. The best place to start with is to pick one or two marketing activities that you can consistently complete for 12 months. It’s far better to do a smaller amount of marketing consistently than to work in fits and frenzies.

Follow your instincts about where you are likely to reach your ideal customer. Then start sharing helpful content for free. The best thing you can do is share your beliefs and solve problems. These two things will build your audience.

From there, it’s just a matter of time.
