# Taking Skymouse to the next level.

We did it. This is the next big step. Me and John started this company just over 2 years ago and now we are ready to embrace the next steps. I will be going full time with Skymouse starting today.

## Patrick is going full time.

## What can you do?
We love all the support from our family, freinds and a few of our life-long enemies have shown that they are just a little bit excited for us.

### Keep you ears peeled for people who could use our help
Not everyone is a perfect fit for working with us, but we'd like to help as many people as we can tackle their marketing and make their brand the wonderful message that it was meant to be.

### Share with us what you're doing and things you've learned along the way.
We would love to hear any stories you have about your own businesses and what change you are trying to affect on the world. It's not easy and we can all learn from each other and we will be the first to admit that we have alot to learn about business.

### Buy one of our t-shirts on this Kick-Starter
If you're as excited as we are you must have already thought about wasting your money on a poorly designed t-shirt. Well have we got a deal for you! You can be the exclusive owner of said t-shirt by joining our Kickstarter!

## Lessons along the way.
This step was mainly motivated by realizing if we wanted to take on more projects and offer more to our clients we would have to up our commitment and for me that means leaving my old job and going full time. It was a scary leap. I've never quite a job before. I'm not a quitter. That's the biggest reason I don't smoke cigarettes.

- The time will present itself
- Don't hold back
- Make sure you have a plan

## So what's next?
Our hope is to bring on new clients each month and grow our team over the next year. We know it won't be easy but we are ready for the challenge and excited for what the future brings.

We will be shooting out a new story each week, so check back here or sign up for our newsletter!

Cheers and much love——

Patrick
