					<h3>We actually put our pricing on the website.</h3>
					<p>We believe in straight-forward answers you can count on. No hidden costs. No vague contracts. Know what youâ€™re paying for and know where your hard-earned money is going. Transparent as a window.</p>

					<h4>Project Services</h4>
					<p>Here is a breakdown of costs, and how our hourly rate works. Note that every project is different, but this gives you an idea of what things cost.</p>
