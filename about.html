						<h3>A Brief History</h3>
						<p class="kill-margin">
						<h4>Boys will become men.</h4>
						</p>
						<p>Everyone and their mother can use photoshop. Anyone can slap a Wordpress template up in the internet. There are too many “companies” that make money off mediocrity.  It’s our goal to change all that.
						</p>
						<p>In the hot summer of 2015, two friends went on a road trip across the country in a 1989 Toyota Corolla. On that trip we talked about everything we loved doing, the things the world was doing wrong and how we wanted to provide solutions that people would love. At our old jobs we were shocked at how many media firms were selling crappy designs and charging an arm and a leg for it! Utter robbery! We realized all we needed was a name and eight hours later Skymouse was born. (SkyRat just wasn’t as catchy.)</p>
						<p>We moved out to Indianapolis and lived in a small dark apartment together and didn’t get much work done. But we argued a lot and talked about how cool we were. Wives were found, and money needed to be made so we finally buckled down and started doing cool stuff that actually got us places.</p>

					<h4>We are on a mission.</h4>
					</p>
					<p>Every project is different and has new, exciting challenges. We love what we do and we try to share it with anyone who will listen. Check out some of our past projects here. You can also follow the action (almost) live on one of our social media accounts.</p>
					<p>	
					We love our families and our friends and are always trying to help the people that we work with and interact with. We may not be saving lives, but we can definitely make people’s lives easier and (hopefully) happier.
