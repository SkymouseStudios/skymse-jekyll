			<p>John from Skymouse Studios came highly recommended as an experienced content creator and consultant and he did not disappoint! John gave our team a crash course on how to write blog posts as a B2B company while keeping SEO in mind, and the session was packed with actionable tips and guidelines. This was a great start for us and we're looking forward to working with John and his team again in the future.</p>

			<p>The team has stepped in to help our small business holistically solve marketing problems that had us at a standstill. Great flexibility to come alongside us and give a full package of what we needed, and didn't try to pile on extra costs. Great respect for what John and his system can deliver! Web traffic is up!</p>

			<p>Our non-profit has been publishing online content and programming for years now. One of our greatest pain-points has been cycling through web developers, mostly because of poor communication and delayed timelines. Patrick and his team at Skymouse have been communicative, on-time, and helpful in making improvements that we hadn't seen. That's to say, working with Skymouse is like working with humans! And that's saying a lot in an industry that is less and less based in relationship. Recommend!</p>

			<p>The value, professionalism, responsiveness, and quality of the work Skymouse has done for us at the Archdiocese of Boston have all been outstanding.

			<p>Skymouse Studios have provided me with marketing, rebranding, a new web site, LinkedIn support and general marketing strategy for the past couple of years. I endorse Skymouse Studios and their business approach to take this off business owners hands to allow them to focus on their business. Thanks Skymouse!</p>

			<p>Patrick, and Skymouse came in to help rebrand our commercial real estate firm and build a comprehensive website that increased web traffic by 30% â€” we went from 1 lead a month to about 2 per week! His knowledge and understanding of what we needed was invaluable. It was great working with him!</p>
