Email is the worst. It's messy, confusing and gets out of hand really quick. The idea of using email as a to-do list is silly. The best way to shoot your productivity in the foot is "working out of your email."

You wouldn't believe how many people I know who spend 2 hours or more in their email. It's a businessman's Facebook. It's addicting.

1. Create tasks and prioritize.

   I use Asana for all my project management. So every time I have a new email involving a task, I create a task, copy any important information over and then archive that email. Asana has a feature that allows you to forward to a special email and a task is created auto-magically. It's wonderful. If you don't use Asana us a to-do list or a CRM, if you company has one.

   If it's information I want to hold on to I add it to my Evernote. Your email is not a notebook. Stop treating it like one.
2. Schedule for later.

   I use Spark as my email client. It's great for scheduling emails. That way I do all my email tasks at once. My goals is to not be sending emails peppered through the day.
3. Schedule time to look at email.

   I check my email as infrequently as possible. If I must do it, do it at a designated time, like once an hour. "Going through email" has nothing to do with productivity. It is a waste of time. Get in to your email, respond immediately if you have to, send any tasks to Asana and then archive the rest. Boom. The cool cats call it "Inbox Zero."


4. Archive everything.

   I keep my inbox empty. You heard right. If I need to find an old email, I search the archives. Indiana Jones style. By sorting and archiving all my email, I don't lose track of important tasks. When I archive something I know that I can track it's progress on my to-do list. 


5. Unsubscribe from things you don't need.

   I can't believe how I still get emails that I don't care about. I get in the habit of deleting them. I now unsubscribe from emails that I am not going to read. It prevents having to delete them every week. If I want to read the blog post later I add it to my Pocket app. Pocket lets me keep all my reading in one place.
6. Put alerts somewhere else.

   I forward most of my alert emails to Slack. If I want to see when I get a new lead from our website or a new subscriber on MailChimp, I've set my alerts to show up in Slack. This can also be done with Microsoft Teams and some other messaging apps.

Your life will be better once you get a handle on your email.

You will know what you need to work on. You will spend less time wandering through your inbox. You might even have time to get home at 4pm and sit by the pool for a bit.
