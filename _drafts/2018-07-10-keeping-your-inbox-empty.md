Email is the worst. Its messy, confusing and gets out of hand really quick.  Are you one of those people with 13,397 unread emails in your inbox? The idea of using email as a to-do list is silly. The best way to shoot your productivity in the foot is "working out of your email."

You wouldn't believe how many people I know who spend 2 hours+ in their email during the work day. It's a businessman's Facebook. It's addicting.

1. Create tasks and prioritize.

   I use Asana for all my project management at Skymouse. Every time I get a new email involving a task, I create a task in Asana, copy any important information over and then archive that email. Asana has a feature that allows you to forward emails to an Asana email address and a task is created auto-magically. It's wonderful. 

   If you don't use Asana, just use a simple to-do list app or a CRM, if you company has one. Hubspot offers a free CRM, that works great.

   If the email has information I want to keep, I add it to my Evernote. Your email is not a notebook. Stop treating it like one.
2. Schedule for later.

   I use Spark as my email client. It's great for scheduling emails. That way I can send out all my emails at once. I can send emails  throughout the day without having to stop what I'm working on. There are plugins for Gmail that help you schedule emails for later.
3. Archive everything.

   I keep my inbox empty. You heard right. If I need to find an old email, I search the archives. Indiana Jones style. By sorting and archiving all my email, I don't lose track of important tasks. When I archive something I know that I can track it's progress on my to-do list. 
4. Schedule your time to look at email.

   I check my email as infrequently as possible. If I must do it, I do it at a designated time, like once an hour. "Going through email" has nothing to do with productivity. It is a waste of time. Get in to your email, respond immediately if you have to, send any tasks to Asana and then archive the rest. Boom. The cool cats call it "Inbox Zero."


5. Unsubscribe from things you don't need.

   I can't believe I still get emails I don't care about. I now unsubscribe from emails that I am not going to read. It prevents having to delete them every week. If I want to read the blog post later, I add it to my Pocket app. Pocket helps me keep all the reading that I want to put off in one place. 
6. Put alerts somewhere else.

   I've set my alerts to show up in Slack. New leads from our website or a new subscribers in MailChimp now show up in Slack instead of my email.  This can also be done with Microsoft Teams and similar apps.

Your life will be better once you get a handle on your email. It takes time to get in a new routine, but it is worth it.

You will spend less time wandering through your inbox. You will know what you need to work on. You might even have time to get home at 4pm and sit by the pool for a bit.
