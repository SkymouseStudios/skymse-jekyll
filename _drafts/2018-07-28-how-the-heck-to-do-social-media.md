**The problem**  
Social media is hard.

**The plan to solve the problem.**  
Create things people care about — take these steps to plan your social media

* Make a plan.
  * Substance (Audience, purpose, topics)
  * Workflow (organized, formatted, and displayed)
  * Structure (channels and format)
  * Governance (Define ownership and roles. Who is responsible for what?)
* Schedule your social media.
  * Find time you audience is online
  * use analytics to see what types of posts do well
  * repost the same content in case it get's lost
* Make a content database.
  * Content is the hard part. Commit to a reasonable goal.
  * Blogs are only as good as you make them.
  * Learn from people who are doing it well.
  * Skymouse does content.
* Use paid media.
  * Jump-start your following.
  * Ensure you reach your followers.
  * Promote a specific campaign.

**How life looks once the problem is solved.**  
You will have a following that stays engaged and your posts will add value.

***

People post random crap to social media. _They might think “Oh this is better than nothing.”_ But that is dangerous. It’s like dating a girl for 5 years and everyone warns you she's bad news, but you assure everyone “it’s better than nothing.” Well you’re wrong. People lose respect for what you have to offer and stop inviting you to family functions. But if you get a reputation for posting great content, more people will follow you, share your content, and buy what you're selling.

> The goal isn’t to have followers—it’s to have a following. Following (n.) People who care about what you say because it helps them get what they need.

Jesus had followers because he healed leprosy. He gave people what they needed. Here are some examples of people and business who have content people love.

* Gary Vaynerchuck (media and motivation)
* Adam Dunaway (design, the web and humor)
* Andrew Kramer (motion graphics and animation)
* Invision App (freelancing, design, productivity)

If you’re going write something, write something people care about. Hone in on your audience. Don’t try to please everyone. It’s impossible. Just ask my girlfriend’s mom.

Content Strategy for the web

### 1. Sit down and make a plan.

Don't panic. No one wants to do this. Plans take time, and that’s okay. Your social media followers will thank you later. Every organization has its own vibe. This should be evident on your social media.

#### Substance

**Audience**  
Who your is your audience? What they want and how you can give it to them in a format they understand and love? Do they want to see a beautiful office space or a colorful report with the biggest real estate deals in your area?

**Purpose**  
What is the purpose of your social media venture? Is it for recruiting? Is it to reach potential clients?

**Topics**  
Your topics are a result of your Audience and your Purpose. What are you going to share. What can you offer your clients that they want to see?

#### Structure

**Channels**  
Where are you going to post? The answer lies in where you audience is. Don't guess. Find out. Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin all have information about the size of their users and their industries.

**Format**  
Are you going to use video? graphics? Downloadable PDFs? A combination? I recommend starting with something achievable.

#### Workflow

**Organization**  
How will you content be organized? Is your website going to be the focal point of where you information is kept? Or will most of you content be native to the social media platform of your choice? 

Where will original files be kept? I always keep original files on our server. Any time we want to update a graphic or reuse a post, we know where to find it.

#### Governance

**Roles**  
Decide who is in charge of content. Make it clear among your team what is expected from each person. If everyone needs make 3 posts a month make sure that is understood. Set deadlines.

**Ownership**  
I recommend putting someone in charge. It's important for there to be a point-person who oversees the workflow, structure and substance of your plan. If there is no ownership your entire social media strategy will come crumbling down.

### 2. Use a scheduler like Buffer or Hootsuite.

Chances are you don't have time for doing social media every day of the week, not to mention it can quickly become overwhelming.

I am personally a huge fan of [Buffer](https://www.google.com), I like the format, the organization system and how it lets me do what I want. You don’t necessarily need a social media manager like this, but I really believe it’s worth it.

It lets you:

* Schedule post ahead of time
* Focus on creating and finding good content rather than trying to remember to schedule things at the right times and whatnot.
* The analytics tools let you find out what your followers respond to, which is great reference as you evolve your master plan. Buffer has a free plan that works well, especially if you want to ease your way into things.

### 3. Make a list of things you can offer and share.

Be sure to have things that you can post on a weekly or daily basis as they happen, such as changes in Federal interest rates. (Super boring, but your followers might really dig that kind of stuff.) You also want to have ideas for posts that you can plan and schedule ahead of time, like Christmas or Veteran’s Day. Do you have a blog? Ideally you want to be sharing things YOU create. Not just sharing all the time. Sharing isn’t always caring. This isn’t a Coke commercial.

#### Here are some started ideas:

* Make a list of news resources you want to check on a regular basis for articles that you clients are interested in. This could also include twitter accounts, Facebook accounts or some other social media channel that inspires you:
* wallstreet journal
* growINdiana.net
* GoogleMaps


* new data and statistics that can help them do their job better
* quarterly reports or graphs showing how things are changing over time
* Offer a twitter Q&A to help people understand what you do or answer their longtime questions.

People want to peer into your life or the life of your company. What is going on? Any cool team-building events coming up in the future? A big benefit dinner? A group trip to a Dave Matthews concert?

* Take pictures
* Live stream! (FB, Twitter and Insta all allow this)
* Video Interview other people who are there
* Use event hashtags and tag other companies or groups that are present.

Post list 

Open Microsoft Word and write 10-15 actual posts. Feel free to experiment with the tone and style of your posts. Think about what you’re giving away, or sharing and write something you could actually copy and paste into twitter. This is a huge help and helps boost your confidence in the type of things you can put into your queue. This also helps you find actual articles and resources you can share in the context of a social media post. Here are some examples:

Free Stuff
We all love free stuff. Branded hats and mugs, gift cards, tickets to Dave Mathews (I am not really a huge fan, but some people dig that) Offer stuff that only your desired demographic is going to want, that will ensure you are getting followers you actually want. So like local gift cards of you want to keep your following local.

* Partner with other companies to help each other reach more people. Teamwork can help everyone.
* Actual knowledge and new ideas (not just "10 great ways to be just like everyone else.")
* Read what you post, are you interested? Was it worth your time?
* Track your metrics. There is not shame in slow, steady growth. It’s better to have followers that care than a bunch of spam accounts following you.
* Share your own stuff. Real things take work and that’s why not everyone is doing it.
* Live Events and Streaming. Is something going on that people want to see? Company party, grand opening, a sporting event. Give people the inside scoop.

### 4. So what about promoted advertisements?

Promoted is still only worth it if people see value. You want to seduce them into following you. So they go to your profile, are they going to see a stream of awesome content? Or just a slew of shared articles from who knows where? You don’t want to drive your traffic off a cliff.

You also want to show that the money is making a return, so whether thats getting clicks, getting impressions or getting actual purchases, you should go in with a game plan.

### A real world example so you don't have to guess.

#### Our Plan

So let's start with our plan. Let's pretend we are a boring law firm, because I think that's a good example of an organization that might have trouble with social media. We'll call it Zebra & Associates, LLC.

##### What do we want to accomplish?

Social media for the sake of social media is a bad idea. So let's think about a potential call to action here.

* Visit the website (bad idea, we don't know they will convert)
* Follow our social media account (not bad, but not the end
* Call our office (good, we can sell)
* Schedule an appointment (good, we can sell)
* Give us their email address (good start to keeping them in touch)

##### Who is interested in our services (target market)?

Let's say we are focused on millennials who are starting businesses and run into law trouble. What do we know about our target based on current clients and what the market tells us?

Millennial business owners are:

* Usually self-taught
* Don't trust sales people
* Love using Google to find answers
* Spend significant time on social media

What makes social media more powerful is a powerful brand. A good brand is about knowing your market and how you take action to serve that market. We have a free [eCourse on boosting your brand](#), that could be helpful here, so we encourage you to check it out!

##### What do _______ people look for in a law firm?

You can guess what people want to know, but it's far more effective to ask people what they want to know and pay attention to things you are already proving people in the office or on your website. Get asked the same question a lot? There might be an opportunity to share something with others. Here's a list of what people might like to see on Zebra & Associates, LLC page.

* They are looking for helpful, easy-to-consulme information
  * How to solve a problem on their own
  * Resources they can download (contract templates, etc.)
  * Engaging videos about a specific law topic/problem
* They want to know they can trust your firm
* Most of the time people don't know what they don't know, so you can educate them.
* Show them you are people who care about each-other and

##### Do we have a plan for a content pipeline? (blog, resources, links, photos)

We need to make sure we have a plan for getting content together. So whether we have an intern at our disposal, we are paying a company to write the content for us, or we (the marketer) will be spending time each week on content for social media.

For me, I like to assign a day to content so I can remain in that headspace, and then schedule everything ahead of time.

* share an original blog once a week
* share 7 outside articles a week (1/day)
* share a internal company thing once a week
* share a service offering twice a week
* share client testimonial once a week

So in order to share these, I need to dedicate time to make sure i can get everything together so they can be scheduled.

_Note: Iteration is key, if something does well, we can increase frequency, and if it does not do well we can stop doing it._

##### Schedule the posts in Buffer

So we have our content together, now we can get started on scheduling everything in buffer.

### Everything you need to know

> What you need to do is come up with a plan. Posting haphazardly is just going to get you in trouble. And we ain’t going back to prison.

The truth is that everyone wants the easy way out. We want to share someone else’s stuff and pretend like we are contributing to society. But this is important: Sharing just anything doesn't do anyone any good. People should follow you because you are providing value and helping them get a little bit closer to what they want. This isn’t about you.

That all being said, keep up the good work. The truth is social media takes work. It’s not easy. It’s especially hard when people assume you have a super easy job, because your on Facebook all day. Thanks for taking the time to read all this.

Do you have cool ideas for "providing value” to followers?
