**# The Importance of Project Management**

Project management is one of those vague terms no one takes seriously. Like “self-improvement" or “capitalism.” It’s rarely understood and rarely embraced because getting a project done is hard enough without having to change the way you are used to doing things (or in the case of some people—not doing things). Very often we find ourselves brushing off the use of project management tools, whether it be Asana or Dapulse or Trello or (God forbid) Excel.—claiming they “don’t really work" or “I don’t like how I can’t change the colors.”

**## If you don’t like your project management tool, 9 /10 you’re not using it enough.**

It is very easy to start working out of your email (i.e. Frank emails you asking for you to downsize the 15 attached PDFs, you get started on that right away so you don;t forget, meanwhile you neglect to send the business car proofs to the printers. Best practice here is to move Frank’s request to project management and continue on what actually should be taking priority) If you aren’t continuously touching base with your project management tool, things get cluttered and outdated very quickly. Once that happens, you are wasting time sifting through things that have already completed or trying to add things you could swear you did yesterday before the pizza party.

**## Don’t laugh at the idea of a Project manager. (Laugh with him, not at him)**

Regardless of where you think you can cut corners, project management is not one of them. People think that they can manage a project as they work on it and a great way to save money is to not hire a project manager. While this may save you upfront costs, you are then spending time and effort managing a project as you work on it. That is a ton of extra work you can farm off to someone else, so you can focus on what you do best. Your time is probably worth more than the project managers.

**## The befits far outweigh the mild annoyances—It’s like your mom making you clean your room.**

If you do work you are probably wasting a lot of time trying to remember what you need to be working on, documenting problems you run into and tracking the time spent on each project. Sure you can keep ideas in your head, but that means you are wasting precious brain power on things you don’t need to be thinking about. Project management is about focusing in on one thing at a time without neglecting stuff that needs to be done.

**## Find one that fits your needs—There are 100 ways to skin a cat and 100 more to manage the project.**

Not every platform fits every job or every person. Find out what your team needs and really learn it. Muddling around is not the same as taking the time to read some documentation or watch a couple videos. Once you decide to use something, commit, and then stick with it, make it work. It’s like a marriage. You have to be giving 100% the whole time, otherwise you waste a lot of time and money and potentially lose custody of the kids.
