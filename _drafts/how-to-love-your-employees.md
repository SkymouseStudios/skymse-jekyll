**Let's Talk About Your EX...** (Employee Experience)

In a world where User Experience, Client Experience and Whatnot are so important, what about the way we treat our employees as business owners? That's right. We are talking about Employee Experience.

Unemployment is insanely low right now. Seriously, in September of 2018, unemployment was the lowest it has been since 1969 and Nixon. What does that mean for employers? People have options. The economy is booming, and employees simply do NOT have to take whatever they can find. There is skilled labor shortages running rampant, and employees have the upper-hand in this current market.

When employees can see green grass and brighter pastures, how can a company retain quality employees and attract the right new hires?

Internal branding. Yeah, in a market where employers are competing for their workforce, it becomes critical now more than ever to brand your company to attract hardworking millennials.

I know what you may be thinking: Are millennials even worth the time? Yes. There is this stereotype that millennials tend to be lazy and flaky and yadda yadda, and we are. We love tacos. We love sriracha. But a lot of us? A lot of us love creating, innovating, challenging, and reimagining the world. We are visionaries, and you would be wrong if you felt that your company couldn't use a healthy dose of millennial.

I’ve spent some time as an employee, and I don't think any of my employers would have a single bad thing to say about me.

Employers love to complain about the work ethic problems of millennials, and they are always trying to figure out how to capture good talent and convert good talent to great talent.

The problem really? The older generation of the corporate world hates that we know how things should be done. We aren’t just some lazy demographic. We are a demographic that values balance, and we are sick of the corporate closed-mindedness. We want to get things done. We want to change the world. We want to rock business, but we want to be happy while we doing  it. We spend so much of our lives working. It's time to step up your amenities guys. Happy employees are productive employees. Don't loose them because they are unhappy.

Below is a few ways to create a company worth working for, and to prevent those valued employees from leaving you.

**You Never Made Time for Me:**

There were a couple cool things that I liked about working as an employee at my company, but for every "cool" aspect, there were dozens of maybe "not so cool" aspects.

The biggest of which: Companies expect you to be flexible (work overtime), but they are rarely flexible with you.

Millennials value their time. Shocking I know, but there are place we would rather be. We like work, but working is not necessarily living. Is it?

Flexibility is huge for millennials.

While it’s important to have structure in the workplace, I don’t think structured formats should dictate something as unpredictable as life. Maybe that old "Work hard. Play hard." mentality is overdue a renaissance.

Millennials want to work harder for shorter periods of time. It's basically like a kid eating their vegetables. We want that bit to go as quickly as possible so that we can get to the dessert (the weekend).

There are so many options that a company can embrace to achieve flexible schedules:

* Let your employees work remotely. In an age of technology, more companies than ever have the ability to have their employees work remotely. The digital commute is wildly appealing to millennials that love the flexibility of being able to travel. If they are capable of working where they are most comfortable, the quality of their work will shine through, and employers are much less likely to suffer from the restlessness of millennials that are always looking to relocate to the next "hot city". If they aren't cut out for work-at-home? They likely aren't the world's best employee anyways.
* Companies like Google famously embrace 20% time. Basically employees work the standard five day work week, but Friday is a free day (20% of their week) in which they can spend their time working on whatever company related passion project they choose. They have the freedom to choose. That flexible freedom reduces stress and encourages creativity. 


* Embrace the "Four-Day Week". That's right. Every single weekend is a three day weekend for employees. A recent study, which you can read [here](), proves that cutting an entire day of the week maintains the job performance and productivity of five full days, lowers employee stress levels, and increases work life balance. If a company can accomplish the exact same objectives in four days as five, while increasing the quality of life for their employees? Isn't it just cruel not to embrace that?
* 

Overall, employees love the power to choose. Let them choose, or even if you don't let them choose, let things be a little slack and loose. Companies, like VaynerMedia, offer salary employees unlimited paid vacation. Reward hard work, and allow your employees to indulge in a life outside of the workplace.

**Let's Talk About Our Feeling:**

Make sure your employees know your vision. Keep them updated, ask their opinions, and perhaps more importantly? Value them. 

People don't like being invisible, or if they do? Maybe you should be hiring more "go getters". If you value the opinion of your employees, if their ideas are being taken seriously, if they have invested interest in the company, they are going to work harder and become less restless. Employees that feel like their position is critical to the success of a company are probably less likely to just leave without a significant notice. If they are valued and feel that, then in my experience, they will in turn value that company. 

If your employees had a really rough day? Realize that. Letting your employees go home early after a really tough day could be the tiny little difference that makes them actually come back in to work the next day. Make sure employees leave your office happy more often than not, and assign a few awesome tasks instead of just crap jobs constantly.

Wednesdays are rough. Wine Wednesday anyone? We aren't saying you need to condone drinking in the workplace, but we do love the mentality of encouraging little midweek treats that give employees something tangible to destress and enjoy their week just a little more. Break-room donuts are overplayed. Be original and 

**They're with You For The Money:**

Be upfront with how much you are willing to pay.

I think it’s ridiculous. Salary negotiation shouldn't be a game of poker. I experienced the agony once, and I really didn’t know what was going on. Should I show my hand first? Should I try and get them to show me? I read that supposedly $1 million in salary is left on the table during a person’s lifetime due to poor salary negotiation.

Companies offering their "bottom dollar" are companies not willing to invest in their employees. Pay an employee what they are worth.. not what minimum wage says they could "survive" on. How can an employee work effectively if they are constantly worrying about their next meal? Stop haggling, and don't let them haggle you. Determine what is fair based on the industry and the workforce available to you, and BE FAIR. Employees will respect reasonable offers without insult, and while they may try to negotiate? Odds are, if your dollar amounts are super different, you're not a good employee/ employer match anyways.

**It's Over:**

Overall, millennials just value jobs that offer some sort of flexibility, decent pay and benefits, and bosses that actual care about them. I don't think that's ridiculous, far-fetched, or outlandish.

Creating flexibility options, leveraging little details that say "I care", and paying people fairly will be more than enough to create the foundation of your companies brand. Employees love the details. "Oh Ginny! You should come work for BLAH BLAH. They let you bring your dog to the office!". Making your job and company something that your employees want to tell the world about? Well, that's all the marketing you really need to keep HR flooded with brilliant resumes.
