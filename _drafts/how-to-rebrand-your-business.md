## How to rebrand your business.

Steve started a business. He wanted to help companies keep their floors clean. Steve started walking into business and asking them if he could sweep and mop and vacuum for them. He offered a good price and more frequent cleaning schedule than other floor cleaners in the area. In a couple years, his business soon had more work than he could handle. 

As his business grew, he kept asking himself, "why are the floors I'm cleaning so darn dirty all the time? It seems odd that in the short time between cleaning, the floors manage to get this dirty."

So Steve had an idea. He asked a few of his clients if he could spend a few hours a week in their offices to observe the environment. Over the next two months, he spent some extra time in their offices and paid attention to what went on. At the end of the two months, he had a clear picture of what was happening. 

As it turned out, 80% of employees ate their lunch at their desk. These lunches varied from sandwiches and chips to soups and salads and everything in between. While these employees were eating, crumbs would fall on the table, or soup would spill, or lettuce would fall on the floor. Steve quickly saw the origin story behind the mess he would find, even with his frequent cleaning schedule. 

So Steve did some research. 

He spent 3 months learning about the psychology of behavior. He found out that there were ways to influence employee behavior in the workplace without overtly trying to enforce rules. Steve knew he had stumbled upon a truly groundbreaking business opportunity. Instead of spending his time cleaning floors, Steve could help businesses create environments that fostered better cleanliness habits in their employees. This would dramatically reduce the yearly cost of paying for floor cleaners. 

There was only one problem. Steve had just spend that last 2 years building a reputation as a floor cleaner. Who on earth would take advice on implementing behavioral psychology methods in the workplace from, essentially, a janitor? 

Steve knew he had to do something. He had to rebrand. But how? How could he change the perception of his business from doing manual cleaning labor to being a workplace behavior consultant? Steve realized he needed some help. He turned to a marketing company called Fanatical Mindset and asked them to rebrand him.

Fanatical Mindset knew what they were doing. They had helped many business owners in the exact same position as Steve. They started by asking Steve some questions. 

"Steve," they said, "tell us about your current clients. Why do they use you to clean their floors?" 

Steve didn't know why. He assumed it was because he cleaned more often than the competition while keeping his price similar to other cleaning services in his market. 

"That's okay, we hear that a lot. We'll help you find out." 

Fanatical Mindset spent a couple months talking to Steve's customers. They asked these customers why they liked Steve's services, why they bought from him in the first place, and why they were still using him. Then they took all that information and boiled it down into a couple of specific things that all of Steve's customers said about him.
