Creating the best EX (Employee Experience)

In a world where User Experience, Client Experience and Whatnot are so important, what about the way we treat our employees as business owners. I’ve searched some time as an employee and I noticed a could cool things that I liked, but some pretty obvious things that were not ever taken into consideration. If a company expects you to be flexible (work overtime) Then they should be flexible with you.

Employers complain about the work ethic problems of millennials, and are trying to figure out how to capture good talent and convert good talent to great talent. Think it’s easy to think that we know how things should be done. Please. We aren’t just a demographic, we just are sick of the corporate closed-mindedness and want to get things done and be happy while we do it.

While it’s important to have structure in our workplace, I don’t think we should think of things in a structured format. Think of it in a lets-get-a-ton-done-and-make-people’s-lives-better-format.

-Let your employees work overtime
If things need to get done, and someone wants to do it, sweet. Let them do it.

-Let your employees work remotely. If they don’t get work done, you know who the bad ones are. People play this game like they don’t want to know how bad their employees are. They would rather live in an illusion thinking things are just fine. The less they know, the better.

Make sure your employees know your vision. 
Keep them updated, ask their opinions. Tabatha has no Idea what the company was about. She didn’t realize that we are trying to be a young, cool company. If she doesn’t understand that, than she isn’t able to orient what she does on a daily basis

Letting your employees go home early after a really tough day. 
Making sure they leave your office happy and enjoy doing awesome sometimes difficult things.

Be upfront with how much you are willing to pay.
I think it’s ridiculous, the more I think about it how a poker game is played when it comes to salary. I experienced the agony once and I really didn’t know what was going on. Should I show my had first? Should I try and get them to show me? I read that supposedly $1 million in salary is left on the table during a person’s lifetime due to poor salary negotiation.

The more freedom you give your employees, the more their try colors will show and you can really find out what type of people you actually hired. Gone is the time where a slow, useless employee can get past the boss without doing much work or driving good employees away from the company.
