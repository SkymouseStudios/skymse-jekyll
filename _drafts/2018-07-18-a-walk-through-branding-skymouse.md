## Building a business is hard.

Writing how we did it is even harder.

Me and John Welch went to the same school, where we met and realized we wanted to do great things. We didn't know what that meant or how we were going to go about making it a reality, we just knew that we liked working together and we would figure out the rest.

It really began when the company my dad works for heard that I did video and asked if we could do some training videos for them as well as a promotional video about the company.

Me and John drove in my 1989 Toyota corolla across the country from Indiana to the job sit in Washington DC. It was on that trip where we cycled though name after name, trying out different combinations of verbs, adjectives, things we liked, dark ironic things and things we didn't know where they came from.

`Insert: Some of the more ridiculous options`

We finally did land on Skymouse. Skymouse studios. John got to be satisfied with his love of rodents and I got to love out my love for flying if I was a super hero. We sketched and doodled ideas for logos, trying to nail down something we could get behind. This was a tough job. there had to be some sort of meaning. We had to be intentional with our brand because people would see it and want us to be intentional with their brand.

`Insert: Some logo ideas and sketches` \`

### Early Brandstorming

The question we really needed to answer was "what do we want?" Why were we doing this? It started off as such a vague idea, but we really had no clue what direction we wanted to go in. At the time, we were stumbling around in the dark, blindly trying to figure things out. We are still figuring things out now, but I like to think we at lease have a couple flashlights.

_Mission:_ To provide quality marketing and entertainment implementing design.

* We want to provide for our families
* We want to learn from the people we partner with, they have unique perspective of what works for them and each company has a different story to tell.
* We want to learn everything we can to provide the best customer experience and product
* We learn new software, we learn new tools and technology
* Find new ways to do solve problems
* We want to teach people what creates, consistent and engaging, long term customer relationships

John: driven, engaging, musical, quick, intelligent, growing, adaptive,
Patrick: honest, problem-solver, creative, funny, open-minded, imaginative

Vision: To provide a great client experience

Brand Personality: Entertaining and Positive
Positive communication is always better received. People know when they see our logo, something great is about to follow. A herald of greatness.

Communication Goals: Continuous and accurate communication. We educate the client, guiding them through the adventure.

**Brand Voice:** Relaxed, entertaining, responsive, clever

Expressed through this visualization technique our style says: The unknown is exciting and shouldn’t be feared. Don’t be afraid to plunge into the pool. Be hopeful.

**Color Pallete:** Muted, organic tones of orange and blue with a gray base color. White accents. Retro, futuristic illustration. Paper textures. Vintage. Earthy and organic. Lasting and friendly. We are everlasting.

Logo Typeface: Motor Oil vintage font, sharp edges. Classic.

Motor Oil for main titles
Avenir Next for Body (Sans Serif)
We need another font for our Heading 1/ for internal thoughts and dialogues.

 1. Codify your vision We must maintain a unified and consistent brand identity. The website, business, cards, logos and animations must all have the same voice and the theme so people know its coming from us.
 2. Determine the value of function benefit you promise to deliver. We are a brand launchpad. We educate and mentor as we go, working with you to tell your story and send you on your way.
 3. Our story is a mouse trying to reach his cheese up in the sky. He has to be inventive, persistent and creative. Sometimes he fails, but he keeps on trying.
 4. Determine your core values. We want to craft brand stories. That is what we love. Our partners want to share their story. We create a great design experience and user experience.
 5. Elevator speech. We partner with aspiring brands to help them create and implement their vision by crafting a beautiful and functional client experience. Resulting in a sustainable marketing strategy and the knowledge to carry that strategy into the future. We are looking for partners, not just clients.
 6. Further Concepts: Brand experience - elements that make up your brand and how it is delivered to customers and clients.
 7. How do we effectively communicate our concepts to people who do not understand the digital world or the marketing landscape of this era?
 8. When talking to a CEO: we need to communicate how we can increase their profits through greater brand cohesion and consistency.
 9. When we are talking to a
10. Twitter bio. Welcome to skylab (Mouse in a lab jacket), cool ideas, insights and stuff to distract you from your real work. Questions? Just ask. (We bite a little)
11. Visual Identity. Our logo is a pin with wings and cheese. The pin being a sign of accomplishment and the cheese being the goal or end result desired by the (mouse) people
12. Resume. Start with a funny story hook. Illustration and picture split. Skills and abilities chart. Disc profile explaining how we help each other and balance each other out.. What we have done and our hopes, dreams and aspirations.
13. Website. Everything is anchored in the website. It’s the hq for our brand with everything else off shooting it. “A safe place.” What we’ve done and what we can do for you. Client testimonies, case studies. We need a client path/experience to help them satisfy their needs.

Something I think is very powerful is the concept of illustration. It personalizes you as a brand, it makes you stand out and it also creates a mystery, a sense of awe amongst you followers. I once read a blogpost that explained why the CEO of a company does all the illustrations for their blog. It shows you care. It shows _intention_. People like that. People feek cheated when they just see your website is a wordpress template or a simple squate space site. People know the difference. They can feel it. That's why the big brands get the super expensive websites, it shows they care.

We had to do the same for our customers. We love our customers and now we have to prove it.

## So how do you make money? Systems. Welcome to SkyDev.

Building a better tomorrow, today. We need to keep re-evaluting ourselves and what is important to us and how we are hitting our benchmarks. Charging too much is one way to make money, but we thought of another one. What if you just learn how to do something so well that you can do it better and more consistently than everyone else? We document our processes and we work hard at growing ourselves with every client.

At first SkyDev was just me and John, working like pigs in a tiny, poorly lit apartment. As we grew we decided we wanted to open up SkyDev to the who team. We realized we were in this together and there is something about transparency that brings people together. Building Skymouse is a project we all work on and can all feel good about rather than just keeping it limited to our daily client work. We are also a client to ourselves.

I was really inspired by "The One Thing" by Gary Keller, as well as DHH's book "Get Work Done." so we adapted som methodology to help us get things done for people.

### Questions we ask ourselves

* What can we automate?
* What takes up the most amount of time during our day?
* How can we eliminate distractions?
* Is there someone else who is better suited to do this job?
* What is the one thing that by doing it everything else becomes easier or unecessary?
* What can I learn today so that I won't have to do this tomorrow?

### Steps we took, or try to

* Initiate "Quite Time.™" where no one is allowed to talk, message or email. We're focusing on getting work done.
* Every meeting must be short or cancelled
* Every meeting must have an agenda
* Work from where you want
* Subscribing to things like Zapier or IFTTT can be so worth it
* We hired an Internal Systems Engineer to make the Skymouse Engine sing.

## Building a Team

It's hard to build a team. Doing all the work yourself has it's perks. You know exactly what to expect from yourself, and usually you know when something is down or when you need to keep working on something.

Contractors are cool, but when do you move to hiring someone full time?

Accounting
Hired this out immediately

Project Management

## The Client Experience

How do you show your clients that you actually care? Is it being a smart allec in your web copy? Maybe it's just getting back to them in a timely manner.

* Friday updates, just giving people a peek into the production process.
* 1 hour email response policy (We use this internally)
* Client follow up and survey after every client close-out.

## Pricing.

Every young entrepenuers nightmare. How the heck do you figure out pricing? Me and John went back and forth a couple times between going hourly vs. going per project.

The more I think about it the more I realize per project is better. We are selling a product. Not our time. I don't work by the hour, I work by what I can get done for you. I spend most of my time througout the day learning and documenting, I don't spend it dedicated to doing "stuff."

In order to sell a product I need to know what product you need and every product is handcrafted, so I can't just say, "Here is the standard."

We also wanted to grow  with our clients. For us, a website isn't just a one and done deal, it's a growing living thing th

## What is our Why?

Me and John didn't want to be limited to websites. It was fun, but it wasn't the core of what our purpose. After listening to a podcast with Simon Senik, we realized what we were really missing was our _WHY_. What was our end goal here? Why did we even care? There are a million other things you can do besides making website? Why did we break into it? It took us a while to even figure that out. We sat down and talked about it, thought about it in the shower (not together) and kept asking ourselves WHAT IS OUR WHY? What is the end goal here? What is the dream? What difference are we trying to make in the world?

Here's what we landed on:

Marketing doesn't have to be sneaky. It doesn't have to manipulate.You shouldn't be waiting by the phone wishing your developer would just call you back.

Why do we do what we do? Too many people are telling great stories poorly. Nobody tells a story better than a great brand. When people love your story, they've found something worth paying for.

In a world so full of fake, we're about leading people to Truth. Do people know the Truth of your brand. No matter what we do, we want to share the Truth with others, because why lie when you can tell the truth? What's your story? Is it a good one? Then we want to tell it.

### The Human Experience.

All this talk of user experience, client experience and a buch of people with no experience. What do we want to do? We want to add to and fufill the Human Experience. Let make some great HX. Every business, every company should try to improve the human experience and we want to help them do that.

> We partner with humans to lead others towards a delightful human experience.

_Stories we love:_
Tom's - let's shoe the world.
Digital Telepathy - Make every experinece beautiful
Chick-fil - great food with amazing services
Chipotle - healthy food that is fresh and clean

## So Why do you make television?

Our love for telling great stories can't be stopped. We wish we could, but we can't. It's our why. When you've found your Why it's like a desease. And we want everyone else to catch it.

### Why did you make a streaming service?

What better way to reach a bunch of people? We said to ourselves, what if we had a Netflix that only had awesome stories? No reason to sort around in the $5 bin at walmart. We've done the sorting for you already.

This focus on the truth has kept us accountable too. That's why we are completely transparent with our rates, our products, what goes on in the company. We make mistkaes, we've made a bunch and we'll keep making them. But with each mistake we just hope that we can step a little bit closer to truth.

## The struggle is teal.

* Roles and responsiblilties
* Staying motivated
* 

We worked for a year without making a dime. We had high points and low points, sometimes we would meet every week, other times we would go a monthing without a SkyDev meeting. It's hard stuff building a company.

> The biggest fear is what if I waste my time and this doesn't go anywhere?

It's hard to commit and to spend all day after work trying to build a website or make a handout to sell websites. There is a reason businesses don't get started or fail early on or even 6 years later. A lot of the work was building our own stuff. Starting a company from nothing is really hard, building a brand from nothing is even harder.

We had a couple projects along the way, we built a quick website for John's dad at welch-title.com, which included pictures, a logo,

I built our website off of a custom ordpress theme, and boy was that no fun. I had never built a theme before and I don't look forward to doing it again. There was a lot of stinking code along the way.

## Apps along the way

We couldn't have done this without some great apps along the way. [We handcrafted an article](#) all about how to use Evernote, Zapier and Airtable to grow you business and get things done.
