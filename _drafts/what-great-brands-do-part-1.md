## Great Brands Start Inside

When making an apple pie, there are two "core" elements.

The crust and the filling.

Now I assume you will be making this pie yourself so it's important to select ripe, healthy apples from the start.

People tend to judge a pie by its crust, so engineering the golden brown, hand-rolled crust is worth spending time on.

However, if we spend all our time on the crust and fill our pie with old apples or rotten apples or tasteless apples, no one will enjoy our pie.

In the same way your choice of apples will dictate much of the flavor and success of an apple pie, the your internal company culture matters just as much as the crust. People will excuse a delicious pie for being ugly, but no matter how beautiful your apple pie looks, if it tastes gross, no one will bother with it.

The insides matter.

Before you can be great to you clients and prospects, you must take a look at your internal brand and how that affects your team and internal culture.

### Internal Culture Comes First

I’ve hear countless companies chant “we have great culture.” However, I have had an inside look at those same companies and seen for myself the culture is not "_great_."

Sometimes it's toxic.

It's not a good feeling to realize what you thought was a great company is simply the administration pretending to care. No one likes being lied to—there was no flag to hold up high after all.

There are still great people at these company and I've made wonderful friends, but we connected the most on the fact the culture was poisonous and we banded together because that’s what kept us sane.

Great Culture doesn’t build itself. If you have "good culture" it can go bad very quickly. When one of your "cell-mates" leaves, it can trigger the mass exodus of all the good workers and people who made it a good place to be. The only thing that was getting them through the day was their friends.

So how can we create internal brand culture?

There are three main aspects:

* Hire people whose personalities fit the current culture.
* Offer instruction in a culture from day 1 of employment.
* Give employees lots of feedback on what the values and culture really mean.

### Make Culture Matter

The culture you have will attract the culture you’re going to have.

If you really want to encourage the best talent, you need to communicate your business is indeed a home for the best talent.

You need to be proactive in the lives of your employees. When an employee leaves, if you get bent out of shape, forcing them out early or refusing to pay their accrued vacation time, it all sets a tone for your existing employees.

It shows that you only care about people **if** they do things YOUR way.

### Employees are the front line of your business

Employees need to feel engaged, like they are a part of something. They don’t want to be fed internal propaganda, like posting motivational pictures around the office or repeating the company’s values over and over.

It’s about taking specific actions so everyone feels like they are on a mission, that they are **part of a team** that is going to make a difference in the world.

It’s also important to remember ex-employees are as much a representation of your brand as current employees are. Everyone wants to be proud of the company they work at. All you have to do is give them the ammunition and they will be a beacon of good will for great people and great clients to come be a part of what you are doing.

### What to do so your employees know you care.

It doesn’t have to be anything crazy. It can start with a hand-crafted welcome package when people first join the company. It could be a pre-emptive raise when someone tackles new problems on their own. Or having monthly "hack-days" to encourage building better systems and evolving the way the company solves problems.

> Create touch-points with your employees so they know you have not forgotten about them.

They want to be loved and love starts with just giving them the attention they need, when they need it. It should feel personal and align with the gospel the company preaches about what they do.

#### A warning for the wise.

I once worked at a company that kept calling themselves “innovative" and “creative" but every time new decisions had to be made the leadership balked at the new ideas and would decide on the safe route, often claiming money was the issue.

At the same time, the company was spending thousands upon thousands of dollars on software and technology that no one was using.

Taking action is more than just buying something, **it’s taking the right action** to show you mean what you say.

If you want to be something, your actions have to match up, you can’t just say something and not follow through—this will only instill contempt in your employees and set your brand up for failure—because you’re lying. Whether you mean to or not.

Do what you say you will do!

### Building your brand toolbox

A brand toolbox is about how you execute, "creating a clear, consistent common understanding of your brand among everyone who works with it." Here are some examples:

* Design web pages that do more than list ideas, but illustrate how you take action as a business.
* Create a word bank of adjectives in addition to you core values to help flush out your brand.
* Shoot a fun video that engages viewers and paints the vision of the company so any viewer could easily describe what you do.

In show business, you have a "pitch" that dumbs down the concept so that anyone can wrap their brain around the it.

> “It’s like Godzilla meets StarTrek” or “James Bond as a Family Man.”

Creating parallels and telling stories is the best way to ensure people understand. We see the same thing in Silicon Valley with new apps that call themselves "the Uber for Animal Control” or “It’s like AirBnb for Dogs."

Create a monthly iPhone video with other team members can be fun and help bring everyone together. At one of the companies I’ve worked at we once did a “Harlem Freeze” video (back when that was popular). Everyone in the office got super into it and was showing it to their family, friends and clients. Especially in boring industries, having some aspects of fun can separate you from competitors in your business and break up the monotony.

Here are some other examples:

* A birthday sombrero that people have to wear on their birthday. (Creating rituals and traditions.)
* Provide customer profiles with illustrations so people know the type of clients that you work with and when they are out in the wild we can say “AH! I found one!”. The idea is to help people recognize the right opportunities for your business.
* Employees can submit stories and ideas they had for making the company experience better and more engaging. Share those ideas with the whole team and award prizes for the best idea.
* Hold brand engagement sessions on each level of the company. Starbucks held “Brand days” for it’s managers.

The goal is to make employees feel like they contribute to the brand and it’s not just a bunch of old guys in a conference room deciding what the brand is. It’s made up of each member of your team.

In one of the businesses I worked with, some employees would not attend events or team building exercises. Sometimes because they were too busy, but many times it was because they "didn’t want to" or "didn’t see the value" in it.

People like this are a poison to your culture. They make everyone else feel inferior. No matter how much money they are bringing in, people like that are hindering the overall growth of the business and tearing down your hard work of building a great culture.

#### Branding is not Marketing’s job.

It’s **everyone's** job to build your brand, marketing just plays one role in that.

How do you track engagement?

Employee surveys van track how they are understand the brand strategy and implement it on a daily basis. Anonymity is important for getting accurate results.

(Brand Happiness Level, people should be happy and delighted to go to work.)

### This is a long-term game.

It’s not going to be one event or one company values handout. It’s about walking the walk.

If you want to show your wife you love her, buying a necklace once a year is not going to do it. You have to spend time with her, find out how she wants to be loved and then continue to show her with your actions.

It’s a lifestyle, not a magic formula. You will need to alter the habits of your business.
