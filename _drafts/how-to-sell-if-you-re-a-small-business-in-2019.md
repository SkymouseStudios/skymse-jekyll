# I'm sitting at my desk...

... the phone rings. I don't recognize the number, but it could be that supplier I called earlier returning my call. I answer the phone, "this is John."

"Hello, John," says the disembodied voice on the other end of the call, "do you have 27 seconds for the easiest sales call you're going to get this year?"

I hang up the phone.

# Why is this still going on?

That's a rhetorical question, in case you can't tell. It's 2019 and we're still fielding sales calls when we're unlucky enough to answer the phone. I used to marvel at the way that salespeople continue to (doggedly) pursue their prospects using tactics that annoy on a good day and cause downright anger on a bad one.

Every day on LinkedIn I see another post (or 300 posts) from members of the sales community. It's like they speak their own language. It's always something to do with "delivering value" or how "selling is serving." I used to be one of them. I used to carry the torch. I was a believer.

# So, what happened?

I'll tell you what happened, I opened my eyes.

It took me a while to understand what was going on. I was talking to business owners on a regular basis and they all had the same thing to say. They all agreed that they never answered their phone, they usually asked their friends for good vendors to use, and they almost never accepted appointments with sales people.

So why was I constantly hearing about how salespeople who were really doing it right were crushing?

I finally found the answer.

See, there are a lot of people in the business world who make a really good living telling companies how to "sell." Now, I don't think for one minute that these people are dishonest. They may be, in some cases, but I have no reason to think so.

What they are, is living in a vacuum. A sales vacuum. These sales gurus spend almost all of their time interfacing and communicating with salespeople. SDR's, BDR's, Account Executives, Sales Managers, VP's of Sales, Directors of Sales, etc... And when they are talking to a business owner or a non-salesperson, they are talking to that person about the fact that they're having sales problems.

In effect, every single conversation these sales "gurus" are having is with sales-related one.

It finally clicked for me. This is how it was possible for me to hear one thing from the actual business owners I was talking to and then to hear the complete opposite from all the sales people I ever spoke with or had contact with in any fashion.

# Here's my problem...

The issue that I was seeing was the complete disconnect between the people doing the selling and the folks receiving the selling. Here are a couple of the nuggets that I find particularly aggravating.

* If you believe what you sell has value, you owe it to your prospects to call them.
* Cold calls work. If they're not working for you it's because you're not delivering value.
* You must spend your 

I'm a millennial. As much as I hate the generational stereotype game, it is an effective way to quickly establish a high-likelihood of shared preferences and mindset.

Based on that idea, I'm definitely a millennial.

That being said,
