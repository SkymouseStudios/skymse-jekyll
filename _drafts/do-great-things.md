# **What you lack in talent, you can make up for in time**

## **Truly amazing things can be done by you (Passively)**

You can do awesome things. the only thing you lack is the drive. At any given moment there is nothing preventing you from transcending your current self and learning something, doing something or creating something.

## **You can always learn new things**

No one else can solve your problems. It is not possible. Only yo can solve them. Google changed the way we live our lives, but still few people utilize it. Unless you are looking for a reason to talk to the cute girl in your office, you shouldn’t be asking her what the shortcut to save as is in excel. Google it.

There are a ton of website dedicated to learning both useful and not useful things. Facebook is an example of non-useful. Lynda or Skillshare is an example of useful. Imagine if you spend your free time watching tutorials on how to knit instead of watching another episode of Inkmaster. You could have a bitchin’ quilt or two by the end of the year! Does knowledge go the world’s weirdest spots to get a tattoo really help you in any way? Stop telling yourself that you are learning something because you’re not.

## **Don’t be afraid to invest time**

Time is the most valuable thing we have as humans. Once you realize this you might live your life a little differently. I have completely cut out television and movies out go my schedule, the only time I watch TV is if I am with people and that is the consensus among the group that we should spend time staring at a box rather than talking to each other.

Note:

That is also why you should be giving TIME to you spouse, TIME to your children and TIME to the people who matter in your life. Absolutely nothing can replace it. No birthday present is big enough, not water park is fun enough to replace the time you can give your children especially.

    **### Drawing Awesome Illustrations**

I am by no means a great artist. I enjoy art and Art is one of those things I literally willed myself into being semi-decent at. I can very proudly claim that I decided I wanted to draw, so I get a ton of books on drawing, I watched videos and I pestered my uncle with a ton of annoying questions.

A couple weeks ago I decided I wanted to do SOMETHING. I was in a funk and I was tired of not having a) A cool profile illustrations b) My lack of creativity and finished products. (Something I really struggle with)

I spend about 20 hours on that illustration. That is a ton of time. But I went into it knowing that the only way it’s going to look good is if I give 100% and spend a ton of time on it. We have this mentality that we can learn things instantly, but the truth is hard work needs to be put in at some point. We need to pay our dues.

Not only did I spend 20 hours, but I was pulling from about 6 years of drawing, coloring and lighting stuff I have learned over the years. And about 3 years of experience in Adobe Illustrator. That is a HUGE investment. I know a lot of stuff, but I have very little to prove for it except a goofy illustration here and there.

    **### Animating little details**

I was working on an animation for work and I realized I needed to spice things up and make the animation look expensive and professional. So what did I do? I spend a couple evenings working late into the night animating stupid little parts to each little building. I made sure each image was broken into small pieces to speed up the animation process.

One could argue that I might as well hire a professional here. But that is a huge fallacy. there are some things that will take a seasoned animator of 30 years the same amount if time it takes me to do. It is the way it works. We live in an Insta-world and its kind of killing design and storytelling.

Previews ruin movies, movies suck, endless companies shell out thousands and thousands of dollars for mediocre websites. Design and storytelling is a craft. You cannot speed up craft past a certain point. Technology allows us to speed things ups and do higher quality work, but that is no excuse for cutting corners where it matters. LIKE IN THE STORYLINE.

You can see I feel strongly about the decrepit movie industry.

## **In Review**

In the words of my Father: “I’m not angry at you. I am just disappointed.” I am just giving you a word or encouragement to tackle the dreams you have. Just another blog on the pile of endless blogs that no one reads and that offers nothing actually tangible. But wait. Maybe there is.

Pick something you want to better at. Just better. Not amazing. (That comes later)

Pick one recreational thing you want to get rid of. (Like Facebook)

Make an effort to form a habit around the you would like to learn. Give it time. Don’t expect the world by the end of the week. At the end of the week you should be able to say “I learned something new about something I want to love.” Just like your wife’s shopping trips, they add up and before you know it, you will know a ton about the thing you now love.

“IF YOU NOT GROWING, YOU’RE DYING.”
