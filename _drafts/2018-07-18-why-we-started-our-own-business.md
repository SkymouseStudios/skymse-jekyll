Why did we start Skymouse?

Skymouse was born in the back of an old 1989 Toyota Corrolla on a trip from Indianapolis to Washington D.C. 

John and I had met at college, making short films together. We realized there was a real need for better businesses in the world. For us, it's not about websites, or music or design. It's about providing value for people so that they can be successful and grow their businesses. 

> It's about making life better. Helping to make a better Human Experience.

### Skymouse got started for a couple reasons:

1. We were tired of seeing mediocre businesses make money when they didn't deserve it
2. We desire to make a difference in the marketplace
3. Employers don't value their employees or clients like they should

### A look at our Idols
Southwest Airlines is one of our favorite brands. They have an entire culture arount making the customer feel special and their employees are treated great so their customers feel great.
