## Great Brands Avoid Selling Products
The temptation to sell products is a great one, but at the end of the day you should be selling the feeling people get when they use your product. You’re selling "Brand Ethos.”

### Emotions Trump Efficacy
Nike is a great example of this, they could be just a shoe company, but they’ve grown into something much greater. They have created a movement, a lifestyle engaging their customers in ways most companies could never dream of. Apple does the same. You are subscribing to the feelings you get when you experience using mac products. I hate to be a sucker for a brand but I will admin that I will never buy a computer that is not a mac. It’s an experience in my workday that I’m addicted to and it had become far to valuable to me. I can’t let go.

People rely more on their guts than their heads. People still make decisions emotionally.

### Connecting through more than category
Pampers became a partner with parents throughout the stages of their baby’s life. Rather than just selling diapers they were selling on a platform of being an ally in a life journey.

Priority Communications is a company that struggles with selling business telephone systems, simply because that’s what they sell. They are failing to connect with business owners on the platform that they are selling hassle-free telephone systems. 

If you are only selling a product people will boil it down to price. If it becomes a process war with your competitor then nobody wins. It’s a back and forth based on who’s the cheapest on that day. If you sell results—that is where you can get people on customer loyalty and the price won’t matter to them.

### Learning from Anthropology
In order to distill what makes you a great brand, it takes very carefully listening. Nothing is what it seems and you only know what you think you know. It’s very similar to trying to figure out what restaurant your wife wants to go for dinner. She might say she wants Chinese and she might say she doesn’t care but you have to read between the lines and listen for context clues. In order to get a true read you have to go above and beyond in asking the right questions and be persistent.

### Emotional Rescue
Like Apple, Nike, and Chick-fil-a seeking emotional connections lead to long term relationships that are far more stable than the mediocre brands in our life. These relationships take more work, more followthrough but at the end of the day are the ones worth having.

If you can learn to unlock the genetic code of your brand you can cut to the heart of what makes your brand connect with your customers and transcend to a whole new level of what it means to be a brand.
