**The problem**  
Starting your own business is hard. Making it the only source of your income can be scary.

**The plan to solve the problem**  
We did it too. Here's some things we learned. By planning and following these steps.

* Ask family and friends for support.
* Make sure everyone knows what you offer.
* It's okay if it's scary
* Have a financial safety net

**The world you will be in**  
Control your own product. Control you hours. Be independent.
