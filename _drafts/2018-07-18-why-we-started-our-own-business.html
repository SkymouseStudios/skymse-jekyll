<h2 id="whydidwestartskymouse">Why did we start Skymouse?</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Patrick, co-founder of Skymouse Studios. I started Skymouse Studios with John Welch almost 2 years ago in the hope of turning it into a nationwide enterprise that makes the world a better place. As of now we help <em>drive traffic to websites and convert users to paying customers</em> with targeted ad campaigns and webpage optimization.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a lot of work so far and we&#8217;ve evolved our services from a full-service marketing company to a website-only company and then to a branding company.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently we&#8217;ve realized there&#8217;s a real niche available for people who need more people visiting their sites and buying more things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not an easy task, but at the end of the day &#8220;good design&#8221; and &#8220;sweet websites&#8221; don&#8217;t mean anything if they aren&#8217;t doing what they were meant to do: <em>Convert Users!</em>.</p>

<p>Whether you sell clothes, health supplements, retro kitchen appliences or online courses for origami—you need to get people to your website. So how do you do that? That&#8217;s the problem we set out to solve and we hope to help others do it to.</p>

<h3 id="howwegotstarted">How we got started</h3>

<p>Skymouse was born in the back of an old 1989 Toyota Corrolla on a trip from Indianapolis to Washington D.C. where we were doing a video shoot.</p>

<p>John and I had met at college, making short films together. We realized there was a real need for better businesses in the world. We spent the 9 hours talking about what we wanted to do and how we would people.</p>

<p>The conversation continued on through the week in restaurants and hotel rooms. We kept coming back to the same principal: &#8220;We wanted to do this the right way. We didn&#8217;t want to phone it in.&#8221; How can we provide real value to people? Skymouse was beginning to take shape.</p>

<p>I had 6 months of school left, but when I graduated I got a job out in Indianpolis. I left my family in NY to start growing Skymouse with John in the flatlands of the Midwest.</p>

<p>Since then we&#8217;ve had non-violent yelling matches, chats over pizza and a Guinness and done a lot of work.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re exited to help people and we can&#8217;t thank our current clients, families and friends enough for the support along the way. This may be beginning, but we still owe so much to so many other people.</p>

<h3 id="skymousegotstartedforacouplereasons:">Skymouse got started for a couple reasons:</h3>

<ol>
<li>We were tired of mediocre businesses ripping people off</li>
<li>Employers don&#8217;t value their employees or clients like they should</li>
<li>We want more time with our families</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1.dontrippeopleoff.">1. Don&#8217;t rip people off.</h4>

<p>Ever hear of someone paying $40k for a website they werne&#8217;t happy with? Or a developer that you can&#8217;t get ahold of? There is a lot to be desired when it comes to finding good service in the web and marketing business. It&#8217;s also how we connect people with great or bad products, so it&#8217;s especially sad when someone has a great product but can&#8217;t seem to get them to &#8220;fly off the shelves.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can bring a horse to water, but you can&#8217;t make him drink&#8230;unless you make sure find yourself a thristy horse. We find that thirsty horse. It&#8217;s not impossible.</p>

<h4 id="2.everyonedeservestoworkatagreatcompany">2. Everyone deserves to work at a great company</h4>

<p>There are not enough great companies in the world. It&#8217;s a shame, but it&#8217;s the truth.</p>

<p>Southwest Airlines is one of our favorite brands. They have an entire culture arount making the customer feel special and their employees are treated great so their customers feel great. I&#8217;ll spend the extra buck flying southwest becuase I know I can rely on them to take care of me if my flight gets canceled. It&#8217;s when things go wrong that companies show their true colors.</p>

<p>Chick-fil-a is where we love getting our spicy chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. Not only do they have great food, but the Chickfila team has a fantastic brand focused—again—on customer service that keeps people coming back. It&#8217;s the little things like the free sandwich if your order takes to long or the overwelming kindness of the staff. We need more companies like that in the world, and we want to be that kind of company.</p>

<h4 id="3.familyfirst">3. Family First</h4>

<p>What is life without love? It&#8217;s nothing. We do what we do becuase it&#8217;s about providing for our immediate families and doing what is best for them. We carry that principal with everyone we work with. Our vendors, clients, employees and ourselves. We have to stay focused on what&#8217;s really important. It&#8217;s not about the money.</p>

<p>We believe the modern workplace is flawed. The 8&#8211;5 grid is a bad habit and people are not but in positions to succeed. With the energence of remote work, great benefits and crazy perks we want to be one of those businesses that let people work to live, not live to work.</p>

<p>Does marketing save lives? No, but it can make people happier, and help them find exactly what they are looking for. It can give them that &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment where they realize they can transcend their former selves and become the person they where meant to be.</p>

<p>We want to help people be better people.</p>

<h2 id="theendgoalisntwebsites">The end goal isn&#8217;t websites</h2>

<p>We hope to grow, we can&#8217;t wait to hire brilliant peolpe and build a culture of learning. Its not going to be instant, but we&#8217;ve known that from the start.</p>

<p>Our dream isn&#8217;t to &#8220;make websites&#8221; or &#8220;do marketing&#8221; it&#8217;s to be truthful with our clients and lead people closer to the truth. No matter what we&#8217;re doing or what services we&#8217;re offering it&#8217;s all about telling stories that lead people to the truth.</p>

<p>For us, it&#8217;s not about websites, or music or design. It&#8217;s about providing value for people so that they can be successful and grow their businesses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s about making life better. Helping to make a better Human Experience.</p>
