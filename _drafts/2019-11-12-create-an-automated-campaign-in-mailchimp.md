Email campaigns are the best way to communicate with your customers. Email is widely used and as long as you have their permission you can keep you customers coming back from more of your services or product.

If you have someone's email address that is WAY better than having them follow you on Instagram or Facebook. In that case, the social media network owns the relationship between you and your customer. You are at the mercy of Facebook. They decide when you customers see your content.

When using email, YOU own the relationship. YOU control when people see the content and how it's presented. If you control the audience, you can **intentionally build the relationship with your people** and THAT is how you create raving fans.

What's great is that you can get started for free with MailChimp, as long as your list isn't over 2,000 people! With only mild limitations you can use MailChimp to start sending email by the end of this article.

Today you're going to learn **everything you need to know to start sending automated email campaigns using MailChimp.** (Although pretty much everything could be used in ActiveCampaign, Intercom or some other email marketing service provider).

We're going to break up this process into three different stages. Each stage builds on the last, so we recommend following this article in order.

1. Audience
2. Content
3. Schedule

## Let's take a look at how a Clock Shop would use email campaigns.

Got a Clock in the 'Rari? When it comes to email marketing, the industry your small business is in shouldn't matter, especially if it's B2C. The same core principals apply no matter what you do. 

We're going to use an odd example, because chances are you might have an industry that is hard to market.

### Audience

TimeLord Clock Co LLC has a clock repair shop and a sales floor where they sell Grandfather clocks upwards of $15,000 dollars or small kitchen wall clocks that are $30. Immediately we can tell there are at least 3 very different customers.

Your audience can come from a couple different places. Most people won't just give up their email. There needs to be a specific reason for them to share their email address. The best way to get people to join your email audience is to offer something free.

- When someone buys a product or gets a clock fixed the staff at TimeLord Clock Co ask for their email address. (If you're getting started in MailChimp we can import this group of people with a CSV)
- Someone is on the TimeLord Clock Co website, and they enter email to sign up for 20% off their online order.
- At an OktoberFest event, people get a chance to win a free clock from TimeLord Clock Co if they sign up with their email address.

So there are two main buckets that your audience will fall into: your potential customers and your past or current customers. Being aware of these two groups is important.

> Your customers that have already made a purchase from you are the best customers you have. Don't forget about them.

Potential customers

- I'm trying to find out how to get my clock fixed.
- I want to find an antique clock just like my grandmothers.

Current customers

- I want another clock, I'm going to buy it as a gift for my nephew
- My clock isn't working, I need it to be fixed.

Organize your Audience in MailChimp using `tags`. Tags are categories to group people together based on their interests, what they have purchased in the past and what type of content you think they would like. So you might have one like `OktoberFest 2019` or something like `Purchased Clock`

Especially if you're upload contacts for the first time, now is the time to make sure you have properly categorized your contacts so that you don't lose track of what they are interested in or where they came from.

### When to use Mailchimp automations to build that audience relationship.

What's awesome about automations is that you can set them up to go out *automatically* when they need to. So if you have a segment of your audience called "Owns Antique Clock" you can set up an automation to begin as soon as someone is added to that segment.

That means from the moment they are added to that segment they might be sent the first email that gives them a tip about not using Windex on their clock, because it ruins the wood. Here you're establishing the relationship as an expert in the clock department.

Here's what your automation might look like:

1. Person added to list > Thank them for using you and let them know you are there to help.
2. 30 Days Later > Send Email 1
3. 90 Days Later > Send Email 2
4. 90 Days Later > Send Email 3
5. 75 Days Later > Send Email 4

So your "Clock Repair" automation would go out 4 times a year. In two of those we include tips of how to clean your clock safely, in one of them we wish them a Merry Christmas and in another we remind them that if anything goes wrong, we can take care of it for them.

So at a given moment you might have 67 people in the Automation but they would all be in different stages based on when they first signed up.

Automation allows you to add new tags to your subscribers once they've received an email in from a particular stage in your Automation.

Later on, you can also send new campaigns based on who is in a campaign. So if you wanted to send out an email on Black Friday, you could target a segment based on what stage they are in your automation.

## Content

Your Audience informs your content. Your content educates your audience. It also opens the door for them to talk to you or stop by your store. You want to give your customers and future customers any possible excuse to talk to you and start buying from you.

> Spend most of your time on your content.

Your content is the meat between the two slices of bread. If the content is no good, then the work you spent on your audience and scheduling with be wasted.

Plan your content in a word doc or Notion note before you hop into Mailchimp. This will prevent you from getting flustered and distracted in MailChimp. Know what you're going to say and how you're going to say it.

### Customize your "from name" and email address

Mailchimp allows you to customize your `From Name` and your `email` address as long as you've correctly verified it. This is a great opportunity to make things look professional and catch your clients eye.

So I might be using the general email from Skymouse, but I can add a custom from name in order to make the email feel a bit more personal. It's probably better to not use your personal email address, because you might be a bit more likely to show up in people's spam folders.

- Dave The Clockmaster "News@ClockInTheRari.com"

### Write a killer subject line.

It can make or break whether or not the email is opened or not. The best way to measure how good a subject line is any good is the open rate. You want to shoot for somewhere around 30% open rate for most industries, especially if the list of emails is reliable.

A good subject line should be enticing and mildly provocative. One of our big secrets is being specific in your subject line. People hate vagueness. They want the nitty gritty. 

> Warning: The right content matters. Don't send emails about expensive grandfather clocks to a college student who just bought a $30 kitchen clock for his mother. Know your audience. Keep them organized using tags and groups.

This should be common sense, but its worth saying: don't mislead your customers. Your subject line should be an accurate explanation of the content of your email. If you break the trust of your subscriber, they might unsubscribe or never open your emails again.

Here are some subject line examples of things your customers could be interested in:

- Get them before they're sold out: Vintage Clocks have arrived
- Up to 65% off Black Friday sale on ALL wall clocks
- I'm sorry, but do you have the time? Now selling pocket watches.
- Don't be late! Turn your clocks back this November

**Preview text is your second best friend.** Also most email platforms have an option for adding `preview text` This is the text that you see in many email clients (Such as gmail and outlook) that comes after the subject line. Usually the first lines of the the email is pulled through by default, but most times it's something useless like "Does this email look weird" or something dumb like that.

Your email preview text should be something that teases the PRIMARY GOAL a bit more. So if the primary goal is to get subscribers to check out the vintage clocks on the website, you can use the rule of specifics and tease out some of the specific clocks that are for sale. 

The main goal is to generate interest in what you have to offer.

- Leaping Lizards! We've got a clock from the original broadway set of "Annie!"

### Tips for great email content

**Look at examples of great email designs.** A quick Google search is all you need to get your creative juices going. This is the first thing we will do before we make any of our own email templates and designs.

**Use Merge Tags to customize your email content.** Merge tags are a great way to create a customized experience for your users. You can use values based on their email, name, birthday and even what they purchased! A good example is instead of starting off your email like "Hi, we wanted to show you some clocks" you can say: 

"Hi `*|FNAME|*`, we wanted to show you some clocks, like the `*|LASTPURCHASE|*` you bought."

Which automatically converts to something like:

"Hi `Steve`, we wanted to show you some clocks, like the `German Cuckoo Clock` you bought."

**Make sure the layout is clean.** Clutter is bad. If you don't have a designer to help, that's okay. Just use a template or a plain text email. It's more important that you communicate information clearly than getting complicated. If you can, make it your own, people get tired of seeing the templates.

**Pictures are effective, just make sure they aren't too big.** This will help it load faster on mobile devices especially. You really don't need images wider than 600px wide. Most times they can be smaller than that. (Mailchimp helps you do this in their content studio.)

**Get to the point.** Unless this is a newsletter or long-form email, Don't go on and on. If this is about a sale, just say it and move on. If you want to get they to click on your store link, then make that button very obvious.

**Using video is very effective (but keep it short).** This requires more time to record and edit, but it can be worth it. Video is one of the best ways to further your relationship with your subscribers. Keep it short! We recommend not going over 1 minute!

## Schedule

Scheduling ensures you're being consistent with your emails. Luckily Mailchimp has great scheduling capabilities so you can set up automations all but forget about them.

When choosing times to send keep in mind when your customers will be checking their email, how much attention they can give you and when you emailed them last.

Expensive clocks have a long sales cycle, which means you want to keep getting in touch with your customers and future customers over a long period of time.

> Warning: Don't pester your customers. If you're too often with your emails you can very quickly annoy them and they will unsubscribe, which means you can't send them emails ever again.

Over that time many things can happen with your customers, you want to make sure you're helping them along the way and not neglecting them.

Be helpful! You can get to the point where you're helping your customers and they appreciate the emails.

- My clock broke and I keep forgetting to fix it.
- I'm moving and I want to get a new clock that matches my new kitchen, but I didn't realize that until I saw your email.
- I want to keep my clock clean, but I forget how to do it right.

An Automation is the best way to put your emails on autopilot. If someone buys a new clock you can include emails about the 5 ways to make sure your clock keeps on ticking. This builds a relationship with the customer and helps to grow your relationship with them. You can't build too much trust with your customer.
