Create things people care about — take these steps to plan your social media:

* Make a plan.
  * Substance (audience, purpose, topics)
  * Workflow (organized, formatted, and displayed)
  * Structure (channels and format)
  * Governance (Define ownership and roles. Who is responsible for what?)
* Schedule your social media.
  * Find the time your audience is online.
  * Use analytics to see what types of posts do well.
  * Repost the same content in case it gets lost.
* Make a content database.
  * Content is the hard part. Commit to a reasonable goal.

## Social media is stupid, and I'll show you how to fix it.

People post random crap to social media. _They might think, "This is better than nothing.”_ But that is dangerous. It’s like dating someone for 5 years, and everyone warns you that they're bad news, but you assure everyone, “it’s better than nothing.” You’re wrong. People lose respect for you and stop inviting you to family functions. But once you have reputation for posting great content, people will follow you, share your content, and buy what you're selling. Just like mom will buy "She's the one." if she starts bringing the world's best baked goods to family functions.

> The goal isn’t to have followers—it’s to have a following.  
> Following (n.): People who care about what you say because it helps them get what they need.

Here are examples of content people love:

* Gary Vaynerchuck (media and motivation)
* Adam Dunaway (design, the web and humor)
* Andrew Kramer (motion graphics and animation)
* Invision App (freelancing, design, productivity)
* Jesus ( ever heard of a little thing we call the Bible?)

Content Strategy for the Web.

### Sit down and make a plan.

Don't panic. No one wants to do this. Plans take time, and that’s okay. Your social media followers will thank you later. Every organization has its own vibe. This should be evident on your social media.

If you’re going to create something, create something people care about. Hone in on your audience. Don’t try to please everyone. It’s impossible. Just try and bring the best possible baked goods to that family function of yours.

#### Substance:

**Audience:**  
Who is your audience? What do they want, and how you can give it to them in a format that they will understand and love? Do they want to see a beautiful office space or a colorful report with the biggest real estate deals in your area?

**Purpose:**  
What is the purpose of your social media venture? Is it for recruiting? Is it to reach potential clients? Each social media platform can have a different purpose.

**Topics:**  
Your topics are a result of your Audience and your Purpose. What are you going to share? What can you offer your clients that they want to see?

#### Structure:

**Channels:**  
Where are you going to post? The answer lies in where your audience is. Don't guess. Find out. Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and LinkedIn all have information about the size of their users and their industries.

**Format:**  
Are you going to use video? Infographics? Downloadable PDFs? Youtube livestreams? Content comes in many shapes and sizes. I recommend starting with something simple and achievable. You don't want to bite off more than you can chew.

#### Workflow:

**Organization:**  
How will your content be organized? Is your website going to be the focal point of where your information is kept? Or will most of you content be native to the social media platform of your choice?

Where will original files be kept? I always keep original files on our server. Any time we want to update a graphic or reuse a post, we know where to find it.

#### Governance:

**Roles:**  
Decide who is in charge of content. Make it clear among your team what is expected from each person. If everyone needs to make 3 posts a month, make sure that is understood. Set deadlines.

**Ownership:**  
I recommend putting someone in charge. It's important for there to be a point-person who oversees the workflow, structure and substance of your plan. If there is no ownership, your entire social media strategy will come crumbling down.

### Make a list of things you can offer and share.

Post on a weekly or daily basis as events happen. Changes in Federal interest rates—super boring, but your followers might really dig that kind of stuff. Posts for Christmas or Veteran’s Day can be planned ahead of time.

Share things YOU create. Don't just re-share other posts. Sharing isn’t always caring. This isn’t a Coke commercial.

**Post List:**  
Once you know your audience, your platform and your purpose, open Microsoft Word and write 10-15 actual posts. Feel free to experiment with the tone of your posts. Think about what you’re giving away or sharing, and write something you can copy and paste into Twitter. Boost your confidence in the type of things you can put into your queue.

**Starter Ideas:**

* Make a list of resources for articles that you clients are interested in: Twitter accounts, Facebook accounts, blogs, email newsletters.
* Make a list of items your customers would find helpful: Statistics that help them do their job better, quarterly reports or graphs showing how things are changing over time.
* Offer a twitter Q&A to help people understand what you do or to answer their longtime questions.
* If you are using social media for careers, think about what people want to see. New recruits want to peer into the life of your company. What is going on that you could show them? Cool team-building events coming up in the future? A big benefit dinner? A group trip to a Dave Matthews concert?
* Live stream! (FB, Twitter and Insta all allow this.)
* Video Interview other people who are there.
* Use event hashtags and tag other companies or groups that are present.

**Free Stuff:**  
We all love free stuff. Branded hats and mugs, gift cards, tickets to Dave Mathews (some people dig that). Offering stuff that your desired demographic wants will ensure you get the followers you want.

* Local gift cards if you want to keep your following local.
* Partner with other companies to help each other reach more people. Teamwork can help everyone.
* Actual knowledge and new ideas (not just "10 Great Ways to Be Just Like Everyone Else.")
* Read what you post; are you interested? Was it worth your time?
* Track your metrics. There is no shame in slow, steady growth. It’s better to have followers that care than a bunch of spam accounts following you.
* Share your own stuff. Real things take work, and that’s why not everyone is doing it.
* Participate in Live Events and Streaming. Is something going on that people want to see? Company party, grand opening, a sporting event? Give people the inside scoop.

### Use a scheduler like Buffer or HootSuite.

Chances are you don't have time for doing social media every day of the week, not to mention it can quickly become overwhelming. Schedule posts ahead of time. You can schedule posts for a full month or more!

I am a fan of [Buffer](https://www.google.com). I like the format and the organization system. Buffer has a free plan that works well. You don’t need a social media scheduling app like this, but it makes life much easier.

Focus on creating and finding good content rather than trying to remember to schedule things at the right times and whatnot.

The analytics tools let you find out what your followers enjoy, which is a great reference as your Master Plan evolves.

### So what about promoted advertisements?

Promoted is still only worth it if people see value. You want to seduce them into following you. So they go to your profile, are they going to see a stream of awesome content? Or just a slew of shared articles from who knows where? You don’t want to drive your traffic off a cliff.

You also want to show that the money is making a return, so whether thats getting clicks, getting impressions or getting actual purchases, you should go in with a game plan.

### Everything you need to know.

> What you need to do is come up with a plan. Posting haphazardly is just going to get you in trouble. 

Social media takes work. It’s not easy. We want to share someone else’s stuff and pretend like we are contributing to internet society. But this is important: Sharing just anything doesn't do anyone any good. People follow you if you are providing value and helping them get a little bit closer to what they want. This isn’t about you.
