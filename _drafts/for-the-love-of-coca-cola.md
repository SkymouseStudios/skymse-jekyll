People love to complain. Soda causes obesity. Soda has high fructose corn syrup. Soda is bad for our bodies. Yeah, maybe these things are all true, but Coca-Cola as a company has been GREAT for the world. That's right. Great. I love them. I truly do. Which is pretty hilarious because the only time I drink soda is when I can't find a different suitable option.

Coca-Cola is a long standing company, and it is by no means one of those new-age startups that we at Skymouse are so incredibly fond of, but Coca-Cola is timeless, and there is so much to learn from a brand that is this massive. What is so phenomenal? They are selling liquid obesity, yet somehow they are simultaneously making the world a better place. Ironic huh? 

Coke started way back in 1886 when a pharmacist create a tonic concoction that would change the world forever. According to the World of Coca-Cola website, during that first year of sales, only around 9 servings (what ever size those may have been) were sold a day in Atlanta. Now? More than 1.9 billion servings are sold every single day across the globe. ([Source](https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/ "about-us-coca-cola-history"))
