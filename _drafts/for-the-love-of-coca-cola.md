People love to complain. Soda causes obesity. Soda has high fructose corn syrup. Soda is bad for our bodies. Yeah, maybe these things are all true, but Coca-Cola as a company has been GREAT for the world. That's right. Great. I love them. I truly do. Which is pretty hilarious because the only time I drink soda is when I can't find a different suitable option.

Coca-Cola is a long standing company, and it is by no means one of those new-age startups that we at Skymouse are so incredibly fond of, but Coca-Cola is timeless, and there is so much to learn from a brand that is this massive. What is so phenomenal? They are selling liquid obesity, yet somehow they are simultaneously making the world a better place. Ironic huh?

Coke started way back in 1886 when a pharmacist created a tonic concoction that would change the world forever. According to the World of Coca-Cola website, during that first year of sales, only around 9 servings (what ever size those may have been) were sold a day in Atlanta. Now? More than 1.9 billion servings are sold every single day across the globe. ([Source](https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/ "about-us-coca-cola-history"))

So, how does a drink that has been labeled as "liquid obesity" that causes "tooth rot" and "premature death" (alright, thats a little heavy-handed) still command such a huge following in the marketplace? 

Simple. They are a brand that does so much good in the world, that people refuse to acknowledge the bad. "Sure, Coca-Cola will give my a questionably round body shape, but when I drink a Coca-Cola...I am supporting a company that supports the world and doesn't simply line it's own pockets. Getting obesity is really a statement that I too support the world."

So let's start from the beginning:

**WWI**

Coca-Cola really started as a medicine of sorts. While it didn't really appear to do much of anything it had a cult following? Why? It simply made people feel better (or it could've been cocaine, but Coca-Cola denies this bit). In fact, it made people feel so insanely good that "Coke" became a staple good for just about everyone. It was so popular that soldiers in WWI literally wrote to the Coca-Cola factory in Waco, Texas asking for them to supply Coca-Cola as they would certainly be defeated unless they had an amble supply to help them survive the heat and defeat their enemy. Coca-Cola literally won World War I. If you want to read the actually letter, you can check it out [here](https://www.thedailymeal.com/read-letter-wwi-troops-calling-coca-cola "read-letter-wwi-troops-calling-coca-cola"). Warning: It's really cool.

**WWII**

Coca-Cola didn't stop with World War I. They fought in WWII as well. During WWII Coca-Cola distributed over 5 billion Coca-Colas to men and women in uniform. 5 billion! Coca-Cola was so involved in the war effort that they created what is called the "jungle fountain" which was the combination of an ice machine and a dispensing machine. Over 1,100 jungle fountains were bring "fountain drinks" to the South Pacific during the war. The Coca-Cola President Robert Woodruff simply did not care. Coca-Cola products were going to win the war, and they did. ([Source](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coke-and-the-us "stories-coke-and-the-us")).

Prior to WWII, Coca-Cola had about 44 international plants. During WWII that number grew by half again, up to 64 international plants total. Most of which were converted to standard production factories after the war ended.

**The 60s**

In the 1960s, Coca-Cola made their position on health and nourishment clear by realizing what they called the "Nourishment Project". Partnering with scientists, nutritionists, and food technologists, Coca-Cola worked towards creating another medicine of sorts. The goal? To create a protein rich beverage for undeveloped nations suffering from impoverishment. Several of these style drinks released in poor Latin- American nations. Yet another drink to make people gain weight, only this time is was constructive weight gain for a cause.

**The 80s**

In the 80s Coca-Cola did yet another amazing thing. They created the Coca-Cola Foundation, a foundations that gives back to the world 1% of the previous years earnings. 1% doesn't seem like much, but in 2017 that 1% equated to over $130 million in charitable giving that focused on clean water initiatives, women empowerment, education, and community development. ([Source](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/the-coca-cola-foundation "our-company-the-coca-cola-foundation")).

**The 2000s**

The new millennium did not detract from the companies charitable habits. In 2001, Coca-Cola created the Coca-Cola African Foundation dedicated to treating and preventing HIV/AIDs. In 2007, they partnered with the World Wide Fund for Nature to work towards freshwater conservation, reduce their carbon emissions, and promote sustainable agriculture. In 2009, they developed PET bottles created from recycled material and 30% plant mater. And the list of amazing world conscientious deeds goes on and on and on and on.

So, why did you just read a list of facts bragging about how great Coca-Cola is? Because this brand image is the very thing that keeps Coca-Cola successful. One of the most distinguishing features of Coca-Cola is simply its dedication to the greater good. Who cares if their drink causes obesity when it wins wars, makes people happy, provides the world with clean water, and empowers women. Coca-Cola knows their product is not exactly the healthiest, but they are not phased. They are secure in their brand because for every accusation Coca-Cola faces, they have a dozen proven counter actions that disprove that their company "promotes" whatever accusation they are facing.

How can anyone say they promote an unhealthy lifestyle when they are nourishing the world, curing disease, and supplying people with a clean source of water? Sure, it may be ironic, but you can't accuse them of active wanting the world to be unhealthy. All things in moderation right? Overconsumption and an inactive lifestyle isn't really the brand's fault is it? 

Coca-Cola is a brilliant company that is over a century old. Why? They built a brand that people love and respect. When your clients feel good about your brand. When your consumers think of your brand as part of their family, as willing to fight the same battles and wars they are, or as concerned with the very things they are concerned about? Your company establish a rapport and comfort with those clients. So when something bad is realized (like your cause obesity, tooth decay, blood sugar spikes), your consumer can treat you just like an old member of the family. Sure you may have your faults, but you're still a part of this family. We might not see you quite as often, but you are still a part of the family, and you are always welcome here. 

Building a brand is embedding yourself as part of the family, which means pulling your own weight when your family is facing trouble. Coca-Cola has embraced the world as their family, and as such, the world isn't prepared to ever abandon them, and Coca-Cole won't abandon us. They are here to stay. They are family.

That is good branding.
