People love to complain. Soda causes obesity. Soda has high fructose corn syrup. Soda is bad for our bodies. Yeah, maybe these things are all true, but Coca-Cola as a company has been GREAT for the world. That's right. Great. I love them. I truly do. Which is pretty hilarious because the only time I drink soda is when I can't find a different suitable option.

Coca-Cola is a long standing company, and it is by no means one of those new-age startups that we at Skymouse are so incredibly fond of, but Coca-Cola is timeless, and there is so much to learn from a brand that is this massive. What is so phenomenal? They are selling liquid obesity, yet somehow they are simultaneously making the world a better place. Ironic huh?

Coke started way back in 1886 when a pharmacist created a tonic concoction that would change the world forever.

Coca-Cola really started as a medicine of sorts. While it didn't really appear to do much of anything it had a cult following? Why? It simply made people feel better (or it could've been cocaine, but Coca-Cola denies this bit). In fact, it made people feel so insanely good that "Coke" became a staple good for just about everyone. It was so popular that soldiers in WWI literally wrote to the Coca-Cola factory in Waco, Texas asking for them to supply Coca-Cola as they would certainly be defeated unless that had an amble supply to help them survive the heat.

Warning: It's really cool.
