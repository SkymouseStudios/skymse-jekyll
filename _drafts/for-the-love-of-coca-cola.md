People love to complain. Soda causes obesity. Soda has high fructose corn syrup. Soda is bad for our bodies. Yeah, maybe these things are all true, but Coca-Cola as a company has been GREAT for the world. That's right. Great. I love them. I truly do. Which is pretty hilarious because the only time I drink soda is when I can't find a different suitable option.

Coca-Cola is a long standing company, and it is by no means one of those new-age startups that we at Skymouse are so incredibly fond of, but Coca-Cola is timeless, and there is so much to learn from a brand that is this massive. What is so phenomenal? They are selling liquid obesity, yet somehow they are simultaneously making the world a better place. Ironic huh?

Coke started way back in 1886 when a pharmacist created a tonic concoction that would change the world forever. According to the World of Coca-Cola website, during that first year of sales, only around 9 servings (what ever size those may have been) were sold a day in Atlanta. Now? More than 1.9 billion servings are sold every single day across the globe. ([Source](https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/ "about-us-coca-cola-history"))

So, how does a drink that has been labeled as "liquid obesity" that causes "tooth rot" and "premature death" (alright, thats a little heavy-handed) still command such a huge following in the marketplace?

Simple. They are a brand that does so much good in the world that people refuse to acknowledge the bad. "Sure, Coca-Cola will give me a questionably round body shape, but when I drink a Coca-Cola...I am supporting a company that supports and serves the world. Getting obesity is really a statement that I too support the world."

So let's start from the beginning:

**WWI**

Coca-Cola really started as a medicine of sorts. While it didn't really appear to do much of anything it had a cult following? Why? It simply made people feel better (or it could've been cocaine, but Coca-Cola denies this bit). In fact, it made people feel so insanely good that "Coke" became a staple good for just about everyone. It was so popular that soldiers in WWI literally wrote to the Coca-Cola factory in Waco, Texas asking for them to supply Coca-Cola as they would certainly be defeated unless they had an amble supply to help them survive the heat and defeat their enemy. Coca-Cola literally won World War I. If you want to read the actually letter, you can check it out [here](https://www.thedailymeal.com/read-letter-wwi-troops-calling-coca-cola "read-letter-wwi-troops-calling-coca-cola"). Warning: It's really cool.

**WWII**

Coca-Cola didn't stop with World War I. They fought in WWII as well. During WWII Coca-Cola distributed over 5 billion Coca-Colas to men and women in uniform. 5 billion! Coca-Cola was so involved in the war effort that they created what is called the "jungle fountain" which was the combination of an ice machine and a dispensing machine. Over 1,100 jungle fountains brought "fountain drinks" to the South Pacific during the war. The Coca-Cola President Robert Woodruff simply did not care the cost. Coca-Cola products were going to win the war, and they did. ([Source](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coke-and-the-us "stories-coke-and-the-us")).

Prior to WWII, Coca-Cola had about 44 international plants. During WWII that number grew by half again, up to 64 international plants total. Most of which were converted to standard production factories after the war ended.

**The 60s**

In the 1960s, Coca-Cola made their position on health and nourishment clear by realizing what they called the "Nourishment Project". Partnering with scientists, nutritionists, and food technologists, Coca-Cola worked towards creating another medicine of sorts. The goal? To create a protein rich beverage for undeveloped nations suffering from impoverishment. Several of these style drinks released in poor Latin- American nations. Yet another drink to make people gain weight, only this time is was constructive weight gain for a cause.

**The 80s**

In the 1980s coca-cola launched something pretty amazing, the Coca-Cola Foundation. This gives back 1% of all the prior years earnings to the community. Yupp, 1%. Now that may not seem like a whole lot, but that has translated to over a billion dollars invested clean water initiatives, women empowerment, and general world well-being. 

**The 2000s**

The 2000s have been no exception to the great generosity and philanthropy demonstrated by coca-cola. They created the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation that works towards preventing and treating HIV/AIDs. They introduced PlantBottle Packaging which were made of 30% plant matter, and then later developed the PET bottle prototype made entirely of plant material. And perhaps best of all? They capture the spirit of the holidays with those insanely adorable polar bear ads, and bring joy to the world? I mean thats basically the best form of philanthropy know to mankind right?

So in conclusion, Coca-Cola is just an insanely amazing company. They care. Isn't that a funny thought? They actually care. They carried us through two world wars. They spread clean water across the world. The spread healthy too, and they focus on green initiatives. And perhaps even more important than anything else, Coca-Cola has the wonderful ability to boost spirits and spread joy. They even had a marketing campaign dedicated to sharing. 

So, I'm not saying that I condone high-fructose corn syrup. I'm not saying that I'm a soda advocate, but I am an advocate for companies that give back to the world. Generosity and community engagement can make your brand. If you can position your business so that it contributes to world culture and gives back to the community, the community is much more likely to show continued support even in light of bad PR.
