**Broke. Broke. Broke.**

The start-up life can be hard. Or even if you have been in business for awhile, hard times strike. Companies not having money to spare is not exactly anything new.

Massive companies go broke with one turn of the economy. Just look at companies like GM and Chrysler. The government bailed them out for billions during the 2008 economic crisis. Billions. Sometimes cash flow is an issue. Don't be ashamed. Skymouse works exclusively with small business, and we are a small business. We understand that sometimes stretching a dollar can be just as important as earning the next.

Now, full disclaimer: typically the team at Skymouse Studios does NOT suggest skimping on marketing. We just don't. That's not because we want your business (we do, but that is NOT the reason). We don't advise skimping on the marketing budget because we want your business to be successful. Marketing is an investment in your product or service that should be translating into greater sales and revenue volume. Marketing is an investment in company success. You get what you pay for. Skimping on that website can look unprofessional. Waiting on "word of mouth" can take so long that your company depletes all of its capital. Marketing is not something to cheap out on if you're serious about business growth.

BUT in the case that you just really cannot spare much else, below you will find 5 marketing ideas that if executed well can gain you traction in a saturated marketplace with very little financial overhead.

1. **Blogs.**

   I honestly cannot say enough about blogging. If you want to make a solid impression on the world? Hunker down and start a blog. Blogs are fairly simple to incorporate on any website. If you don't have a website? Seriously...get a website. People need to find you. Splurge a little please, but even if you are using a template service and dragging and dropping your own, most templates come readily equipped with a blog.

   Blog content is only as cheap as you want it to be. If you're a small business? You don't have to pay anyone! Just take some of your personal time and invest it in yourself. If you're a small business with limited resources, just remember to leverage the capital you do have. In the case of creating blogs, leverage what spare time you have. Sit down and write several at a time. You can post as frequently as you have time to manage.

   Longer blogs filled with quality content can increase SEO which will increase your website rankings, and if you are producing quality content, they can be utilized to create an audience that will buy your products over and over again.

   Blogging is a form of content marketing, and it is one of our personal favorites. If you want to learn more about content marketing, you can download our free white-paper HERE or for just a few dollars access our in-depth ebook HERE.

   Don't forget to capitalize on other blogs. Guest post for other companies in similar fields. This establishes you as an authority in your industry and drives traffic back to your site.

   Don't forget the comment section. Comment on blog posts. Comment on yours and others to generate interest in your company. Every time you put your name into the world is another chance someone may call upon it when in need of a good or service.

2. **Network.**

   This one is so easy, and no offense to blog posts, but sooooo much more fun. If you are truly shoestring budgeting, go out into the world and network. Yupp, that's right. The only thing required is a few elbow rubs and a healthy dose of talking about yourself (or your company rather). Networking events are often free. Yupp. Free. I'm not suggesting you go to fancy galas or high ticket priced events. Nope. I am suggesting grabbing coffee with the local chamber of commerce on that obscure Mid-Monday meeting that nobody could possibly ever make, but that people somehow find time to go to.

   Any free event that gives you an excuse to meet new people. I honestly do not even care if it is a free pottery class at the local community college.

   Word of mouth is a tool for the broke marketer. Talk and talk and talk (in a very tasteful manner) about your company and what you do. Introduce yourself to everyone. People know other people and therefore talk to other people. Introduce yourself. If you own a coffee shop and there are four others in town, all of which are equally delicious and conveniently located, where will the clients go? They will go wherever they have a personal connection. If they know you own that coffee shop over there? That's probably where they will go.

   Sidebar, have you ever heard of MeetUp by chance? There are tons of Networking and event groups that are just the ticket to get your name out there. Even if you don't meet the right people? Maybe the people you meet know the right people.

3. **Social Media.**

   This is probably one that most of you are familiar with. Social Media. Social media is an incredibly strong and cheap form of engagement. According to Facebook Blueprint, one out of every five minutes spent on the internet is spent on Facebook or Instagram. So, obviously you might start with those two categories. Social media can be as easy or difficult as you would like.

   What is great about social media is that these are free platforms in which you can share and engage your current clientele and your future. You can post pictures, share those blog posts, use gifs and memes, you can even host live events on Facebook. Slowly build up your audience and then when the time seems right? Remind them of the goods and services that your company provides, and that they should be indulging in.

   You can even create exclusive Facebook groups for your most "exclusive" patrons. Social media is great in that way. You can truly build a sense of community around your services and products which prompts reviews, discussion, and a genuine camaraderie among people procuring your same goods and services.
4. **Email Marketing Campaigns.**

   If you are a small business, you may not take email marketing seriously yet. That's okay. I forgive you, but I encourage you to reconsider.

   Sure. Nobody likes their email filled with spam and cluttered with useless bits of this and that. People simply do not like that, but evidently it still works. Collect emails. Create a free download to create an email capture. Ask for email at checkout. Whatever you do, get their email. 

   Why? Email is an incredibly easy way to get yourself back into the minds-eye of your audience. Even if they are just going to delete your emails, odds are if you send them that 10% off code for a product they sorta wanted anyways? They are going to consider it more seriously. Email is a great way to reengage and reiterate your presence. Remember, every single time you get your name in front of someone, is another chance for them to call upon it when in need of a good or a service.

   Companies like MailChimp even offer free email campaign management software up to 2000 email addresses. You spend a bit of time carefully crafting and curating your emails and then you can set up and automate the rest of the process. Brilliant. Easy. Wonderful.
5. **Develop Partnerships.**

   This one may be a bit far fetched for many. This always seems so difficult to do, but it's not, and it has tons of benefits. This falls somewhat in the realm of networking in that it is people coming together in an effort to build each other (and their companies) up.

   Partnerships don't have to be difficult or extreme. They can be simple. They can be a promise. A restaurant promises to recommend its patrons stop in at the local gift shop for some neat treats and goodies. That same gift shop recommends that restaurant to shoppers that have worked up an appetite.

   Partnerships can take on an affiliate role in which people who send business your way take a small commission, or if you send business their way, you take a commission. Partnerships can be as complex or as simple as you would like, but the key is to find a mutual ground that benefits both parties. Always carefully consider partnerships, of course, and be certain of the benefits for your company based on the specific agreement before you commit.
