## Why did we start Skymouse?

In a word (or two), Skymouse has always been about creating great things. John and I are both passionate about being creative with a purpose, which is the lifeblood for many businesses.

It’s easy to be passionate about something that matters so much, but harder to make a business around it.

### How we got started.

Skymouse was born in an old 1989 Toyota Corolla on a trip from Indianapolis to Washington D.C.

John and I had met at college, making short films together and now we were on our way to do a video shoot in D.C. As we talked, we agreed there was real need for better businesses in the world. We spent the 9 hour drive talking about what we wanted to do about that and how we might help people build better businesses.

The conversation continued on through out the week, in restaurants and hotel rooms. We kept coming back to the same principal idea. We wanted to start a marketing company that would help deserving people develop worthwhile business ideas. And we want to do it starting _now_.

But we didn't want to phone it in. Our primary concern was: **How can we provide real value to people?** We knew we needed to believe in the product we would be selling. Skymouse slowly began to take shape.

I soon graduated college and left the comfortable familiarity of my family in NY to start growing Skymouse with John in the flatlands of the Midwest.

Since then we've had non-violent yelling matches, chats over pizza, and Guinness, and accomplished a lot. Building a brand, website, and learning more about our craft has kept us busy.

We can't thank our current clients, families, and friends enough for the support along the way. This may be the beginning, but it is a solid beginning, and we already owe so much to so many people.

Our way of work can be broken down into roughly 3 different categories.

#### 1. Do great work.

Ever hear of of a company paying $40k for a website they weren't happy with? Or a developer that you can't get ahold of? There is a lot to be desired when it comes to finding good service in the web and marketing business.

Online businesses are a great way connect people with a product, so it's especially sad when someone has a great product but can't seem to get them to "fly off the shelves."

John and I wanted to create a marketing company that would focus on satisfying our customers. For us, that means doing the best work possible while helping our clients in the long-term journey of growing their business.

Does marketing save lives? No, but it can make people happier, and help them find exactly what they are looking for.

It can give people that "Aha!" moment where they realize they can transcend their former selves and become the person they where meant to be.

#### 2. Treat your employees and customers well.

There are not enough great companies in the world. It's a shame, but it's the truth.

**Southwest Airlines** is one of our favorite brands. They have an entire culture around making the customer feel special. Their employees are treated great so their customers feel great.

I'll spend the extra buck flying Southwest because I know I can rely on them to take care of me if my flight gets canceled.

> It's when things go wrong that companies show their true colors.

**Chick-fil-a** is where we love getting our spicy chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. Not only do they have great food, but the Chick-fil-a team has a fantastic brand, focused—again—on customer service that keeps people coming back. It's the little things like the free sandwich if your order takes too long or the overwhelming kindness of the staff.

We need more companies like that in the world, and we want to be that kind of company. We want to be a company people admire and aspire to be like one day.

#### 3. Put Family First

Ask any entrepreneur why they started their company. Ask them, “What was it all for?"

If they are being honest, most of them will say the same thing. Money.

But what is life without love? It's nothing.

John and I do what we do because creating a business that provides an income helps us love and serve our families.

We try to have that mindset with everyone we encounter.  Our vendors, clients, employees, and the people who work behind the counter where we get our coffee in the morning. We have to stay focused on what's really important. Life is about loving others and wanting what is best for them.

We are all part of the human family and family comes first.

We believe the modern workplace is flawed. People are not put in position to succeed. We knew before we ever got into the workforce that the 8-5 grind was not for us. With the emergence of remote work, great benefits and crazy perks, we want to be one of those businesses [(like Buffer)](https://open.buffer.com/distributed-team-benefits/ "Buffer Blogpost on Remote Work") that let people work to live, not live to work.

We want to help people be better people.

## The end goal isn't websites

We hope to grow, we can't wait to hire brilliant people and build a culture of learning. It's not going to be instant, but we've known that from the start.

Our dream isn't to "make websites" or "do marketing" it's to be truthful with our clients and lead people closer to the truth. No matter what we're doing or what services we're offering—it's all about telling stories that lead people to the truth.

For us, it's not about websites, or music or design. It's about providing value for people so that they can be successful and grow their businesses.

> It's about making life better. Helping to make a better Human Experience.

## What we're up to now

Skymouse is almost 2 and a half years old, and it's been a very educational experience. Our services have shifted from full-service marketing to a website-only company and then to a branding company.

> Over time, we realized business owners need more people visiting their website and buying their products/services.

So we decided to focus our services.

We honed in on _driving traffic to websites and converting users to paying customers_ with targeted ad campaigns and webpage optimization.

It's not an easy task, but at the end of the day, design and websites don't mean anything if visitors aren't doing what they were meant to do.

Whether they sell clothes, retro kitchen appliances, or online courses for origami—businesses need people to visit their website and need them to take action.

So how do we do that?

That's the problem we set out to solve for ourselves, and we hope to help others do it too.
