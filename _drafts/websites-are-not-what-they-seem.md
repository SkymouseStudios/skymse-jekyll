A small business owner, his name was Ted, decided that he needed a new website. His current site had been built in the mid 2000’s and he was pretty sure it wasn’t screaming “sophisticated” anymore. He had one problem though: he had no idea what a new website would cost him. 

### A Story About Ted
So Ted did the sensible thing, he went to Google. He typed in “web developers in my city” and hit enter. What returned was a massive list of oddly named companies whose Google reviews ranged from 1 to 5 stars with an average of 2.8. The reviews were surprisingly mixed, even for the same company. One user wrote, “this web development agency is amazing!!! They got my website done in half the time they quoted and under budget!” Another user, reviewing the same company, wrote, “If I could give this agency less than 1 start I would. I would give them a negative star! Unresponsive, exorbitant fees, no explanations for what they were doing or why it took twice as long as they said it would. NEVER use this agency.” 

Needless to say, Ted was confused. 

Since he couldn’t find any good info online, he decided to fall back on standard business procedure. Ted contacted the three top agencies he found and asked them all for proposals. He thought to himself, “I’ll get a couple proposals, compare them to each other, see what seems reasonable, and go from there.” 
Boy was he in for a surprise. 

After extensive back and forth with each of these agencies, Ted finally arrived at the moment of truth. He had three separate proposals for a new website from three separate web development agencies. It was time to figure out what a new website would cost him. 

Ted started into proposal number one. It began simply enough, but by page 2 he was so lost in jargon that he didn’t know if he was looking at a proposal for a new website or redesigning the internet itself. 
Ted abandoned proposal one and took a chance on proposal two. This one was at least outlined clearly, but when he got the end, he nearly fell out of his chair. The price tag would cover 3 years of rent that he paid for his office space. Ted coughed and quickly deposited that proposal in the trash. 

Not expecting much by this point, Ted picked up the last proposal. It was thick. When Ted turned the first page, he realized it was printed double-sided. It took all of his courage to start reading. He appreciated the simple language and was pleasantly surprised at the readability. He began to hope that this proposal would solve his problem, until he got to the section stating that every single piece of marketing collateral, website content, his entire website, and one of his children, would belong to this company if he used them to build his new website. Ted collapsed into his chair, defeated. 

### You can probably imagine the rest of the story.
Ted ended up finding a cheap marketing agency to build his site. The finished product left much to be desired and 6 months later Ted was so desperate he was considering the agency that cost 3 years rent. We’ll leave Ted before he makes his decision. 

Does it all sound familiar? 

Maybe you’re in the same position as Ted. You would be in good company. Many business owners have been in Ted’s position. These businesses have had only one choice: pay out the wazoo for a new site or continue to limp along with their cheap marketing agency, slowly dying inside because they know they’re not digitally competitive. 

The reasons for this are not hard to understand. The web development industry has done a bang-up job of creating an incredibly confusing landscape. Businesses have no idea what web development should cost. They have no idea how long it should take. They have no idea why one company asks them for the shirt off their back and another only asks for one button. 

#### We’ve reached a boiling point. 
It’s unsustainable. Small businesses don’t have the time or the resources to keep shelling out for new websites when their current site is barely a year old. The Ted’s of the world need something better. They deserve something better. 

	Websites used to be a product, they aren’t anymore. Now, they’re a service. Agencies need to start acting like it.

Much like the IT industry, which has nearly saturated the market with the Managed Services Provider (MSP) model of doing business, so the web development industry must do likewise. It’s the only way for the web development agencies to continue doing business and for the small businesses to afford building and maintaining the websites they need to stay competitive. 

### The future is a Managed Website Provider (MWP). 
Under a managed website provider, a business engages in an ongoing relationship to iteratively build, maintain, and constantly refresh their website. Instead of building a site and realizing it’s out of date in 6 months, businesses build their site intending for it to be out of date in 6 months. That’s why they’ve got a managed website provider to make sure that in 6 months, their site is exactly where it needs to be. 
The cost model looks a lot different, as well. The up-front cost is an onboarding/kick-off fee, roughly 25% of what businesses are used to paying for websites. Then the ongoing costs are around that of a full-time web developer, only the business is getting access to an entire team of developers for that price. For the businesses that understand the value, this is a game-changer. The market will respond. 

### The future is coming and disruption is inevitable. 
The agencies that get on board will win big. The ones that don’t will join Blockbuster, MySpace, and every other company that couldn’t, or wouldn’t, adapt.
