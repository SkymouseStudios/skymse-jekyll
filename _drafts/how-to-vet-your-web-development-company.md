Focus on what you want to achieve with the website

* Set specific goals.
* Know your audience.
* Focus on content first.
* Make things better.

## Focus on solving problems, not just “getting a website.”

Most people rush into a website deal with the intention of finding the cheapest website possible. Websites are like cars. You should find out what you want to do with it. Do you want a Lexus or do you want a used 2003 Kia with a busted windshield and Chinese takeout under the passenger seat?

###### Goals.

### What do you want?

Do you want a Subaru that gets great safety ratings, and drives great in the snow with it’s all wheel drive? Like with buying cars, you’ll realize very quickly that there are a ton of options and it gets difficult, especially when you have a slick salesman who knows you aren’t in you element. Like the guy who buys the Kia, you pay less up front for a cheap website but you’ll end up “paying" way more in the end.

Start small. You can always expand it in the future.

###### Audience.

### Who is the Driver? Your teenage daughter or a 45-year-old lawyer?

Who are your users? Many people have never thought about this. The easy answer is "anyone who wants to drive somewhere” but that is not at all what we are looking for. We want the nitty gritty specifics. We want to be so specific we can make a movie out of this person’s life. People want to be talked to directly and if you haven’t figured out your target, now is the time to do it!

A person’s age, job, level of authority, experience and their mission play a huge roll in how they are going to interact with your website. Build the website _they_ need, not the website you _want_. It’s not about you. It’s about your customers.

### Where do you want to go? Alaska? Arizona?

Some websites are selling a software service, others are convincing you to buy a watch, and others are trying to sell you social media strategy with a very original “Let’s get in touch” contact form. 

Each user is trying to do something on your website. They are there for a reason. Help them get there. If they want to learn about your law firm’s process or how much it will cost to get a logo put on a t-shirt, you clients are on a mission.

## Don’t get sucked in by bearded hipsters wearing plaid.

Sales guys are slick. No matter what they are selling. Just because someone is a Millennial doesn't make them a professional web developer who can effortlessly make you the website of your dreams. There are a lot of companies that will skate through the project, give you what you think you want only to find 6 months down the road any changes would cost more that a new site altogether.

### Changes are inevitable.

Websites need a mechanic, they need oil changes and adjustments. A good website is always changing, adapting to what you customers need and evolving into the best product it can be. It’s not a one-and-done thing.

### You are the expert on you business.

Stand strong.

Ask questions but also let them ask questions. Are they asking good questions? Their number one focus should be your business. Not the website. Your website is a representation of you, someone can scroll through at a red light.
