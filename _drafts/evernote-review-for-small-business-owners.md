Evernote review for small business owners

\# How we used Evernote.

Evernote is not flawless. In fact, we are kind of in a rough spot here.

**## It works and it works well.**

People are often not open to the investment of time that comes with a new piece of software. Evernote is a solid program, that I think is work using, unless someone has a better suggestion, which I would be interested to see if anyone else has some input. (OneNote and others have yet to capture my attention.)

**## When to use it.**

I think you are better off using Apple’s default note taking app if its just a couple notes here and there, but if you have a large number of notes, on different topics and you need to take notes on a regular basis, I would say Evernote is right up your ally.

\## **History** (you can skip this if you’re bored)

I would like to explain my relationship with Evernote. In my freshman year of college, I gave it a shot, I downloaded it on my phone and my Mac, but it really didn't do quite what I was looking for. It was confusing, I didn’t really think it was worth my time, I was really just looking for a place to put the occasional idea here and there.

I ended up just using Apple notes for a year and a half or so. It then got to the point where I was willing to give it a second go, so I got it on my phone and computer (Mac). from there I stuck with things and transcribed things over into a bunch of idea notebooks such as Movie ideas, illustration Ideas, funny, all inside of a stack ideas, I had a stack for school stuff, work stuff, and things I had to do. It worked pretty well. My notes began to grow and grow. I was kind of getting annoyed at my structure because I couldn't always remember where to find what and how to fI was terrified of touching the tag functionality, but I was pretty sure

Things started to get clogged as my collection of “awesome ideas” expanded. I then figured I should probably find out what the mysterious tags where. I figured they where the answer to my problems, I just couldn’t rap my head around the concept.

**## How We Use it.**

Evernote is more personal that mutual. We all use it on an individual level, and then we have a shared notebook to host all the notes we need to share as a company.

* Tags can be grouped to help you organize the different “flavors”
* Think of tags as applying “multiple folders” to one note, rather than notes to only one folder.
* Shared notebooks are for Skymouse

**ex.)** I can add these three tags to a note: _\[#Skymse\] \[#Website\] \[#TL;DR\]_, it means that it is related to skymouse, it is about websites, and apparently I didn’t read it yet, so I added the TL;DR tag, which is my way of saying I am adding it to my reading list.

Using just folders things could be tricky. I might have a stack for skymouse and a website notebook in there, but what if this was a website notebook in my stack called “TTK (things to know)? Should I duplicate the note? Nope. Notes let a note live in as many places as you want. That way you can prevent duplicates and make sure relevant information is always accessible.

TIP: You can also add multiple tags to a search so that I see notes that have both _\[#Skymse\] and \[#Website\]_ So I get a more reasonable group of results.

**UI/UX Reviews**

**Mac**

I will say the mac version if much nicer, cleaner and usable than the windows, which is really too bad, because, there is no reason they can’t be an identical experience in my opinion. My absolute favorite quality about the event on mac, is the cute little shortcut note adder, that lets you add a quick thought, note, or link on the go. It has allowed me to keep track of everything and gives me the ability to revisit ideas, thoughts and articles on the go.

**Windows**

I understand how we could cut corners here. Mac is far superior to windows, I get that, but that all being said the windows version of Evernote is kind of painful. It’s not very pretty at all. It does the same thing, but I don’t enjoy it half as much. You can’t have vertical list view, which is just straight bizarre, and makes me pretty annoyed, you don't have the cool toolbar helper that comes on the Mac version, again one of my favorite features.

**Web version**

The Web interface isn’t bad, Super clean and nice looking, but I just don’t really ever think to use it. I don’t like many in-browser things going on except maybe gmail. Might be a good option if you are on a PC and don’t want to hate yourself.

**Things I would like to see:**

\-A dark mode. I got me some bad eyes and late at night writing a note becomes not fun, staring into the sun.

\-More than one device. (Hear me explain why here)

\-Using Markup to style things and create a quick and clean formatting of notes (DayOne does this well)

**# Evernote is like the horrible parent I never had.**

I love evernote.

I also love my parents.

That doesn’t mean I want to live with either of them if I have the choice.

I currently use Evernote for pretty much everything. Ideas, meetings, things I need to do and beyond. It’s great, there is a ton of functionality and I really don’t have complaints. I won’t lie, I’m even typing this thing up in Evernote. Oh the irony. 

However.

With the recent change in their tier system, I have been forced to reconsider how I feel about them. It brought back a ton of childhood memories.

**## Going back on their word.**

limited devices. YOUR SAID I COULD GO TO THE PROM! Well we said you could, but we changed our mind because…Well just because. Hey, can you clean your room? It’s looking pretty dirty.

**## I don’t feel like they love me.**

I am sure Evernote is a cool company, but I honestly don’t feel the love. I used MailChimp daily and I feel loved. I use Asana and I feel loved. I use Evernote and I feel betrayed. I can’t look them in the eye and after every email reminding me I will only have 2 devices I run into my bedroom, slam the door and scream “I HATE YOUUUUU!” 

**## They love stupid stuff.**

I see them waste money on crap why they could be helping me. -Stupid scanners -$30 notebooks that aren’t actually cool.

I came so close to signing up for premium. It was half off. Why not? **I was literally punching in my credit card number**, but then I realized how truly manipulated I was. It’s like the moment you realize you’ve been dating the wrong girl for about 2 years. _What the heck am I doing??_ I didn’t feel like an adult. I didn’t feel like Evernote was the type of company I wanted to give my money too. Sure I could shrug it off, and pay the 35 bucks for a year. In truth it’s not much, but what this all boils down to is the principle of the Matter. I was promised something. I got it. And now it’s being taken away from me. I don’t like feeling manipulated, so Evernote can do without my paid subscription and I will move on to find something else.

Their business model is manipulative. If I want to see my notes offline I need plus. That’s basically ransomware. I understand completely, they have to make money. They have to keep their servers running. But basic functionality, LIKE SEEING YOUR NOTES should be free. Just my humble opinion. I could understand the sync limit being lowered to 20mb or something, but that actually touches their server, but some of their features are just not delivered in the correct package and it makes a difference in how I feel about them as a company.

I know I don’t have all the facts. I really don’t have many facts. But this is my PERCEPTION. And to be honest, when it comes to creating a brand people love and a product people buy. PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING.

I’m note going to stop using Evernote cold turkey. I do love the app. But I will say, If I should find an alternative, I will be running away from home to my new parents as soon as I find them.
