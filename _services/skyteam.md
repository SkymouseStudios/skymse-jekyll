description: "Take back control of your marketing\n\nYou are drowning.\n\nYou are
  upside down, underwater, with no idea where the surface is. \n\nEvery day is a new
  barrage of emails, texts, and calls. And that's just your spouse asking if you took
  the \"nice\" travel coffee mug this morning. (Of course you did. You snooze, you
  lose.)\n\nRemember how it used to be? \n\nYou started this business to make a difference.
  You started this business to live life on your terms. You started this business
  because you were tired of someone else calling the shots. \n\nNow it feels like
  the same old grind.\n\nYou feel torn. \n\nOn the one hand, you want to grow. You
  want to automate sales. You want to leverage the power of technology. \n\nOn the
  other hand, you're lucky if you have time to take a couple breaths between breakfast
  and dinner. \n\n\n\nYou told your friends, \"I'm going take on the world! Be my
  own boss! Live life on my terms!\"\n\nThey all said you were crazy to start your
  own business. \n\nThey tried to scare you out of following your dream.\n\"80% of
  new businesses fail in the first year!\"\n\"You'll never make enough money to live
  the way you do now...\"\n\"What if you fail? How will you live with yourself?\"\n\nNone
  of it mattered. You were on a mission. \n\nAnd it worked. Against all odds, you
  started a business. You learned the skills, made the sacrifices, and earned the
  results. \n\nIt was amazing, you were running your own business, you were living
  life on your terms.\n\nAnd now... you're reading this. What happened? \n\nIt's pretty
  simple actually. You started winning. You started winning so much that your business
  began to consume you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
