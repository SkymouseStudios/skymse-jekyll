				<h3>Why did we create this course?</h3> 

				<h5>We got tired of marketing companies taking businesses for a ride.</h5>
				<p>Everyone is asking about how to increase sales revenue and grow their business, but all the marketing companies are making it seem so difficult and time-consuming. By hiding behind vague terms like “SEO,” “Content Strategy,” and “Social Media Marketing,” the marketing industry has made digital marketing seem like some sort of labyrinth that only the chosen few can successfully navigate.</p>
				
				<h5>Businesses need a simple, straightforward way to increase sales online.</h5>
				<p>That’s what we’ve put together with the Skymouse Marketing Launchpad. We take you, step-by-step, through the process you need to start driving traffic to your site and converting it to real-world sales revenue. The best part is, we’re right here beside you the whole way. This is not some video course with screen-captures and inspiration videos. This is a real-life, person-to-person relationship we’re starting. We do the hard work, all you have to do is bring your passion for helping your customers and a commitment to investing in your business’s future.
