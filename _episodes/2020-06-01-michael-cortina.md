Trauma is a misunderstood topic, especially in the modern world of psychology. Most people are dealing with trauma on a daily basis, they simply aren't aware of it. 

Michael Cortina joins us in this episode of Humans of LinkedIn to discuss the mind/body connection and how to achieve maximum performance. 

Born and raised in the south suburbs of Chicago, Michael grew up independent and optimistic about the future. From a young age, he knew that he wanted to live an optimal life and knew that there had to be a way for others to do the same. Michael has always been a dreamer who mixed that with an intensely hard work ethic, passion, and action.

### We all need coaches

Coaches get us to the next level. All the pros surround themselves with people who can help them transcend themselves. If you're struggling why wouldn't you seek out help from someone who can help you conquer your monsters?

### The problems people have

Stress from work or life can ruin our lives and our relationships. More people struggle with things like this than you think. It's okay to admit you need help.

### One thing you can do to find peace

Movement is powerful on the journey to mental health. Get active, get outside and don't wallow in self-pity or close yourself off from others.
