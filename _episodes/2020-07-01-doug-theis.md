"Marketing" is a really broad term. Most businesses struggle to make marketing work for them. One of the main reasons is that they are too tied to the metrics. The best and truest forms of marketing involve doing things for other people without expectations of return. When you put value into the marketplace, dollars and cents usually find their way to you. 

Doug Theis joins us this week to discuss using events to grow your marketing. Doug has mastered a marketing strategy that can pay dividends if implemented correctly and shares his knowledge in depth in this episode of Humans of LinkedIn.

You can call yourself a subject matter expert, but that doesn't make you one. The best way to show people you're actually good at what you do is to lead by example. Show them, don't tell them.

### Create events people love

An loyal audience is the best thing a business can ask for. Start by defining who your audience is. Don't get sloppy. Be specific and intentional.

### Client context is everything

No matter what you're doing, if you don't understand the context of your clients good luck growing your business. The best way to show the context of your business and that you understand the context of the business you serve is by creating great content.
