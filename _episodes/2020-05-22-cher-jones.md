### [Is Linkedin really worth it?](https://youtu.be/q5nAohMZNMQ)
You have to change your mindset about Linkedin. It's not just about finding a job, it more about building relationships and growing your network.


### [Don't be forgotten](https://youtu.be/hhwGuxulIuc)
Linkedin isn't just sales and marketing people. Create relationships with everyone so people know what you do and you can help them when the moment is right.
