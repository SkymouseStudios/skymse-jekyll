Today we talk with Morgan Llewellyn about how AI helps not just big companies, but also small business owners. "Artificial Intelligence" is a tool that helps us be **more human** and do better work and not about putting people out of work. AI eliminates the mundane tasks that waste our time so that we can do the things that humans were meant to do.

Some of the things we cover:

- A data scientist's approach to the digital transformation and business
- AI makes us more human
- Economy and behavior: What will the new normal look like?
