Today we're chatting with Doug Miller, the CEO and CTO of Brightworks. Doug has been in the IT business for years and he offers a unique perspective on how his clients are using technology to communicate and get things done during the corona-virus age.

Some of the things we cover:

- using technology to collaborate better
- when to stop working
- humans are adaptive, we tend to underestimate their abilities
- the problems business owners have with expectations

You don't have to be cut-throat in order to be a successful business. We don't need more business like WeWork. Don't get lost in the money or in the technology. We need people to be more human!

### [Humans are Adaptive](https://youtu.be/ijosS5WHJe0)
Change comes at a price. Usually it takes something traumatic to make things better in business. We've seen the same thing over and over throughout historyâ€”and life keeps on chugging.


### [Be Resilient](https://youtu.be/f4madtm22sg)
People don't give themselves enough credit. We tend to overestimate what the dangers of the future are and we underestimate our ability to cope with those unforeseen events.


### [Working too hard](https://youtu.be/UwOICozy0bc)
Work to live, don't live to work. Avoid burnout. Learn how to set up boundaries so work doesn't ruin your life.
