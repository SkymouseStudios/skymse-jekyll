In 2020 the outrage mob has grown to affect and influence every area of American culture. Employees can lose their jobs and livelihoods at the drop of hat. All they have to do is say the wrong thing or offend a certain group of people. 

Business owners can lose their businesses or find themselves the victims of looting, destruction of property, and physical harm if they don't speak out in precisely the way the "woke mob" demands they do. 

On this episode, Jordan Paris joins us to discuss why he has started taking a stand against the cancel culture and what is at stake if the critical thinkers among us remain silent.
