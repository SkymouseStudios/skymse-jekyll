Designed and Developed by Patrick Hanus

### Skymouse Jekyll Release 2.0
We're excited to introduce a blog and case studies! Users now have some cool stuff to look through!

### Skymouse Jekyll Release 1.0
Hey ho! We wanted to try Jekyll out for a bit, so I ripped out the WordPress theme and make a Jekyll site out of it. This will make changes much easier. The site will load lightning fast as a static site.

- Built with Sass (For speedy styling)
- Started things with html5boilerplate
- For additional Changes please see the Changelog
