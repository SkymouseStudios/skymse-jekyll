# SKYMSE 2017
An Awesome theme for awesome people. => Designed and Coded by Patrick Hanus

Skymouse Studios is a project of Patrick Hanus and John Welch. We build websites that people don't hate.

## Versions

### Skymouse Jekyll Release 1.0
Hey ho! I wanted to try Jekyll out for a bit so I ripped out the theme and make a Jekyll sit out of it. This will hopefully make things easier and let me iterate on the site faster rather than dealing witht the bulk of wordpress. I like wordpress, but I don't think I need the bulk, especially if I'm the one making the changes.

-Built with Sass (For speedy styling)
-Used some of the beautiful html5boilerplate, so thanks to that crew
