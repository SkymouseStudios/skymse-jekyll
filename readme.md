# Skymouse Studios 2018
An awesome jekyll theme, still in development. 

Designed and Developed by Patrick Hanus

### Skymouse Jekyll Release 1.0
Hey ho! We wanted to try Jekyll out for a bit so I ripped out the Wordpress theme and make a Jekyll sit out of it. This will hopefully make things easier and let me iterate on the site faster rather than dealing witht the bulk of wordpress. I like wordpress, but I don't think I need the bulk, especially if I'm the one making the changes.

- Built with Sass (For speedy styling)
- Started things with html5boilerplate
- For additional Changes please see the Changelog
